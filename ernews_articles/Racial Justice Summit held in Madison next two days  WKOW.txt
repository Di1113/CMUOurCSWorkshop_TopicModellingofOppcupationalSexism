MADISON (WKOW) -- Over 1,000 people are taking part in the Racial Justice Summit hosted by YWCA this year.

The organization's mission is to eliminate racism and empower women in the work place and society. The summit brings people of different backgrounds together to create dialogue and raise awareness about creating an all inclusive environment.

"Create a space where transformational learning can happen," said Gery Paredes VÃ¡squez. "But also the kind of conversations that are hoping to move us individually and also collectively and across organizations to make more equitable and inclusive communities."

The summit at Monona Terrace continues through Tuesday.
