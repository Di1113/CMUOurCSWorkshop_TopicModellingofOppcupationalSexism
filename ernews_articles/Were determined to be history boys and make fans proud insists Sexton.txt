Today, for the seventh time, Ireland have an opportunity to reach a Rugby World Cup semi-final. Never before have they made it beyond this point and, in what could be his final match in charge, Joe Schmidt and his team face their greatest challenge.

The three-in-a-row-chasing All Blacks stand between Ireland and their goal. This is the fifth and final meeting between the sides during the Kiwi coach's tenure and the score stands at 2-2. This one will go a long way towards defining his legacy.

For the players, it is an opportunity to go where none of their predecessors have gone before and shatter the quarter-final glass ceiling.

Despite their lack of success at this competition, Johnny Sexton says this Irish team is unburdened by history.

"Of course we'd like it to be better but it is what it is," the out-half said of Ireland's record at World Cups. "There's nothing we can do about previous results now. All we can do now is concentrate on putting in our best performance.

"That will give us a chance, and if we can walk off that pitch having played our best, given it everything, we can look at ourselves afterwards no matter what.

"That's what we focus on. The record at the tournament, it's not something that we've overly spoken about.
