I oversee our customer service and returns teams where we focus on all the customers needs, pre-sale and post sale. We answer all their questions. We get contacted via chat, email and phones. That's the first part, and the second part is returns. They may not be talking directly with the customer, but it's all part of the same process.

2. How do you feel Yandy empowers women?

I think overall we empower women because we're all inclusive. We cover all shapes, size, color, and height. We offer products for everyone without any type of discrimination and try to make everything equal.

Internally, we have a strong team of women that work here and I think everyone's voice is heard. We're able to freely give ideas, and I think it goes beyond the fact that it's because we sell women's products.

3. What do you love about our corporate culture?

I like the open door policies. I love the fact that everyone is working towards a common goal and we all work hard. The teams work great together even when we have a lot on our plates. We work hard and we play hard! I like that we're fast paced and the fact that ideas can happen quickly. If someone has an idea about improving our checkout process it's easy to implement it quickly.

4. Talk about your tenure at Yandy and how you've seen the company grow and change.

I am one of the most senior members, I came here when there were five people in e-commerce and two people in the warehouse. On a busy day we'd need everyone out there packing orders, so I've seen the technology and processes change. And not only that, we've learned what we do well and where we can do better. We had very humble beginnings! We used to do literally everything, so I still have to catch myself from making changes to various areas.
