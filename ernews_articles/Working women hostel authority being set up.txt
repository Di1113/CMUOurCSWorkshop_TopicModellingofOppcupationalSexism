LAHORE: Punjab Minister for Women Development Ashfa Riaz said a working women hostel authority was being set up under public-private partnership for providing better accommodation facilities to working women.

She was presiding over a meeting at her office on Friday about the women working hostels in Vehari. She said that the government was taking steps to provide better facilities to the working women.

No country for working women

"Daycare centres are also being set up in institutions where women work. The aim is to help them in the upbringing of their children," she added.

Riaz said that a comprehensive plan had been made for the welfare of women and to protect their rights in society because women were half of the population and their role was important in the national development. She said that private girls' hostels would be registered through working women hostel authority.
