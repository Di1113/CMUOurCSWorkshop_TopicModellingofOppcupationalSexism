Jaipur, Oct 15 : As more and more Indian female athletes break the glass ceiling, ASICS, a running shoes and other athletic footwear manufacturer, on Tuesday roped in ace India paddler Manika Batra as its new face as she launched the brands latest store here. The athlete who put the Indian flag on the map during the 2018 Commonwealth Games in Australia was delighted to be associated with ASICS. Speaking at the store, she said "As a table tennis player, it is important to be comfortable on your feet and quick to respond to your opponent's strike. I have tested ASICS' footwear and found it to be the best match for my attacking game. Their shoes keep me light on my feet, and the Gel technology gives me an added advantage in terms of bounce and agility."
