Hillary Clinton may not have been able to shatter the glass ceiling for millions of girls around the country, but she has been very successful in helping her own daughter break the bank.

Chelsea Clinton, 39, took home just over $600,000 last year for her work as director on the boards of IAC and Expedia, according to records obtained by DailyMail.com.

The IAC board met just six times in 2018, while some members of the Expedia board were only obligated to attend two meetings last year.

Those two companies are both headed up by the family's good friend Barry Diller, the billionaire businessman and longtime partner of designer Diane von Furstenberg, who is often spotted attending Broadway shows with Chelsea and her parents.

These latest compensation packages also reveal that Chelsea will soon own just over $400,000 of Expedia stock and shares in IAC that add up to an astonishing $6.3 million, based on those companies trading prices when the market opened Friday.
