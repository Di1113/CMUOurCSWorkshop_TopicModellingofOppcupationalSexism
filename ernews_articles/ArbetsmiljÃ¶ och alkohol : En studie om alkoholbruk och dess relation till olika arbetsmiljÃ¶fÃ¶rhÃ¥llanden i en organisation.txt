Sammanfattning: The aim of this study is to analyse the connection between employees' work environment and alcohol problems. The emphasis is in detecting elements of risk important for alcohol problems to arise.The empirical part of the study has been carried out at seven different work places in one county council. All employees of these work places have answered a questionnaire concerning mainly work environment and alcohol habits. The major part of the analysed personnel is female and thus it is women's work environment that has the greatest significance for the issue.The outcome shows that there is a relationship between work environment as experienced by the employee and alcohol problems, and alcohol beeing used as a coping remedy. The relationship between work environment and alcohol problems is most conspicuous among blue collar workers. An essential part of the work environment considered in relation to alcohol problems is low job decision latitude, which also is in accordance with previous research on the relationship of work environment and disease. Social unsafety in the worksituation also appears to be connected with alcohol problems. High social security in the work situation seems to be a condition, which partially might protect against the negative effect of low job decision latitude.
