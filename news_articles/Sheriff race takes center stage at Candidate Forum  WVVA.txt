TAZEWELL COUNTY (WVVA) -- The Chamber of Commerce of the Two Virginia's, Bluefield College and the Tazewell County Chamber of Commerce teamed up to host a Candidate Forum ahead of next month's election.

Harman Chapel was a full house Tuesday as Tazewell County residents poured in to hear from their candidates. Nine individuals, seeking various offices, attended to state their positions and answer voters' questions.

However, the night was headlined by the Tazewell County Sheriff race.

Sheriff Brian Hieatt and opponent Kevin Bales took center stage to express what it means to be a Sheriff.

"You have to be a community leader in all aspects," said Bales, "On a day-to-day basis, you're a law enforcement officer, maybe a paramedic.. could be a marriage counselor. There's just so many things involved with being the Sheriff of Tazewell County."

Sheriff Hieatt also emphasized the importance of a leader, saying, "I have a great department. The men and women that work there make this department great. We're a team, and it starts from the top and goes all around. That's what it takes to be a good Sheriff."

Election day is Tuesday, November 5th.
