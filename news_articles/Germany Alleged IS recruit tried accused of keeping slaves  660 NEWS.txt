BERLIN -- A German-Algerian woman accused of membership of the Islamic State group and keeping three captive Yazidi women as slaves in Syria has gone on trial in Germany.

Proceedings against the 21-year-old, identified only as Sarah O. in line with German privacy rules, opened Wednesday at the Duesseldorf state court.

News agency dpa reported that judge Lars Bachler ruled that the proceedings should be closed to the public because the defendant was aged between 16 and 19 at the time of the alleged crimes.

Prosecutors say she travelled to Syria as a teenager in 2013, joined IS and married a fellow German IS recruit. Both allegedly conducted "guard and police duties" in IS-controlled areas, and also forced a Yazidi girl and two Yazidi women to work in their household.
