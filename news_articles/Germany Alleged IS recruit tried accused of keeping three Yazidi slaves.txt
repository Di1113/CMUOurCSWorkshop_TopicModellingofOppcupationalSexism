A German-Algerian woman accused of joining Islamic State and keeping three Yazidi women as slaves in Syria has gone on trial.

Proceedings against the 21-year-old, identified only as Sarah O in line with German privacy rules, opened Wednesday at the Dusseldorf state court.

News agency dpa reported that judge Lars Bachler ruled that the proceedings should be closed to the public because the defendant was aged between 16 and 19 at the time of the alleged crimes.

Prosecutors say she travelled to Syria as a teenager in 2013, joined IS and married a fellow German IS recruit.

Both allegedly conducted 'guard and police duties' in IS-controlled areas, and also forced a Yazidi girl and two Yazidi women to work in their household.

Investigators say Sarah O, described as a 'petite' young woman with hip-length hair and black-rimmed glasses, was 15 years old when she decided to join IS, the Spiegel reported.

Sarah O allegedly married high-ranking IS fighter Ismail S a few months...
