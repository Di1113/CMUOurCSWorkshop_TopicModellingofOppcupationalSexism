Actor-turned-politician, Khushbu Sundar, on Saturday asserted that there was a need for women stand up for their rights and fight for their freedom by breaking the taboos and age-old notions.

Speaking at the Outlook Speakout 2019, Sundar said that if any gender needs to understand what women want, "it is the men."

Sundar recounted the struggles of her life, saying that despite coming from a conservative family, she put questions to her father which were unacceptable to him.

"In 1986, I raised a question to my father which he thought was absolutely unacceptable and he took that opportunity to dump us on the middle of the road and leave me, my mom and brothers in an unknown city of Chennai," said Khusbu Sundar.

Khushboo emphasised on the need of empowering the women so that they can stand for themselves and speak for themselves.

"Everywhere, there are women who are treated as outcast. We need to take a stand for ourselves," Sundar said.

She said that the notion of 'breaking the glass ceiling' is only associated with women. "But why is such a phrase notused when we talk about men?"

The actor-turned-politician said that women need to fight for their rights and look beyond the notions of "men being superior to women".

"You need to fight it out...We are a country that achieved freedom after fighting it out. It's okay to fight for our freedom," Sundar said.

Speaking on the theme "What Women Want", Sundar said that if any gender needs to understand what women really want, "it is the men."

She said the attitude of the society needs to change and the notion that men are superior because they earn needs to be broken. "We talk about gender equality. I say women are superior to men. We are super women," said Khushbu Sundar.
