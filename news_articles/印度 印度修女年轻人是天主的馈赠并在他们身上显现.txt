I hail from Arva parish (Mangalore Diocese), St. Peter Claver, from South India, Born to Late Thomas Fernandes and Mrs. Rosy Fernandes as 3rd child on 18th July 1977. It is a small village situated at the foot hills of Western Ghats. As a child and young girl I had enough opportunities to be surrounded by the church activities, and attend summer camps every year conducted by CRI (conference of Religious of India) of Mangalore diocese. All these opportunities led me to remain very close to the church and choose to be a religious.

I belong to Ursuline Franciscan Congregation; my first profession was on 04.04.1999 and now joyfully completing 20 years of religious life. After my initial formation in South India I was chosen to be a missionary and my first appointment was in Uttar Pradesh, North India. The extreme weather of north India deteriorated my health little by little and I was called back to my home land for my treatment but the ill health was a blessing in disguise. In my ill health I built up close relationship with my Lord, spent time in learning computer, music and Diploma in youth ministry. Thereafter a little stubbornness as well as longing to be a missionary did not give a way to stay back in home land but recharge and return back to where I was chosen before.

On My perpetual profession 5th April 2006, "Pro Amore Dei" (for the love of God) the motto of my Congregation became my personal Motto too. I had a deep desire to be with young minds, to know them, love them and live with them. This great desire led me to Guma (a village in Kolkata), three times a week the little children would gather in different houses and spend time with Bible studies. I had to learn Bengali the local language to be effective in my ministry. My wonderful community and superior along with parish clergy always encouraged me to go ahead in the ministry. Thus for 5 years organized programmes and Bible studies at parish, zone and deanery level. Soon after this I was transferred to the city of Joy Kolkata, served in St. john Berchmans' school as Principal and at St. Mary's School as In-charge-sister, the love to the younger generation increased and that led me not to worry about my responsibilities but to serve the young generation thus I was appointed to the Archdiocese of Kolkata as Diocesan Youth Lady Animator for the next 5 years.

Youth ministry though It is challenging, indeed a great gift from the Lord to see him in his young people. For young every moment, every step, and every thought is a new. Because of my ministry I have faced the challenges of becoming a prey of the Anonymous letters, insults gender discrimination etc. but what is that more important to me is, every young person should know that they are loved, they are precious and they are unique gift from the Lord. When I was appointed as National Coordinator for YCS/YSM India (2018) I grabbed the opportunity and proclaimed to every young mind possible that 'God loves you as you are, you are precious, loving, and unique child of God'. Today as Executive secretary for CCBI Women's' Commission (2019) continue to proclaim the same and make everyone feel important in the sight of God. Today "let us ask to be like that 'kindly lights' amid the encircling gloom." J.H. Newman
