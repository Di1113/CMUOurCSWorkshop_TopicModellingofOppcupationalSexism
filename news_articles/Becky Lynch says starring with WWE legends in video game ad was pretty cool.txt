BECKY LYNCH says starring alongside WWE legends in an advert for the WWE 2K20 video game was 'a pretty cool experience'.

'The Man' is a cover star, alongside Roman Reigns, for the WWE's official game that's scheduled to be released next month.

And the Dublin native was the centre piece of an advert for the game - starring alongside some of the biggest names in wrestling history.

Hulk Hogan and Stone Cold Steve Austin both feature, along with fellow Irish WWE star Sheamus, with the ad set at a cocktail party.

Lynch makes a grand entrance by crashing through the glass ceiling of the building before putting a cake in Hulk Hogan's drink.

And the 32-year-old reflected on the journey she has made over the last year in becoming one of the faces of the company.

She told WWE's 'The Bump': "When they told me the concept for it it hadn't really sunk in.

"With everything that happened in the last year, the main-event of Wrestlemania, the rise to the top.

"Going from hardly being on TV, struggling to get a spot there. From the pre-show of Wrestlemania.

"Just because you're all go and you're always trying to think of what's next and who is your next opponent and how can you make that the best match and how can you rack up a series of classic matches.

"You're always thinking, you're always going and when I sat back and they told me the concept I was like; 'Oh wow. All these people that I looked up to, all these people that I watched they're calling me The Man now. Because I am The Man now!

"It sank in then and that was a pretty cool experience."

WWE 2K20 will be released on October 22nd on Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
