Minister of Women Affairs and Social Development (FMWASD) Mrs Pauline Tallen has called for inclusive and quality education for girls toward achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the country.

Tallen, who was speaking at a press briefing on the 2019 International Day of the Girl Child in Abuja with theme, 'Girls First Unscripted, Unstoppable, Free and Compulsory Quality Secondary Education for All Girls', said adequate investment in girls' education would help eliminate gender discrimination.

She also called on Nigerians to change their attitude towards girl child education and empowerment, describing girls as assets and not liabilities as being painted by some cultures.

Tallen said: "We must recognise the fact that girls contribute immensely to our future and the Nigerian government must consider the empowerment of women and girl children as part of its development agenda."
