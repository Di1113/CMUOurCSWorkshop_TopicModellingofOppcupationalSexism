*"The Bachelorette's" Mike Johnson appears to have the hots for Keke Palmer, as he tried to shoot his shot during an appearance on "Strahan, Sara and Keke" on Monday.

Referencing his brief romance with singer Demi Lovato, Johnson shared, "I made a mistake. I don't like dating in public." Then he turned to Palmer and said: "But if I were to ask you if we could go on a date in the public..."

Palmer was left stunned and turned to co-hosts Michael Strahan and Sara Haines for aide, but they pretended not to hear her.

"What's the next question? What's the next question?" she said. "Michael, you've got the next question!"

"What's that? I didn't hear nothing," Strahan responded. "He lost me when he asked you out for a date. What did you say? Yes or no?"

"You guys are embarrassing me!" Keke said as she promptly moved the conversation forward. "Ladies, I'm at work. I'm at work, guys. Go ahead. I'm at work," she later added.

"Mike Johnson givin' off the big red flags right now. I feel sorry for Keke, being put on the spot like that," someone commented after seeing the clip, per Teen Vogue. TV personality Heather Gardner added, "I know this was supposed to be a cute moment and all, but when will these men stop embarrassing women at work?"

So, did Keke accept? Watch the clip above.
