The use of nonstore retailing by older adults has been well documented. Unfortunately, many of the findings are contradictory and there is still confusion as to the role they play in this sector. The contention tested in this study is that using chronological age as a determinant of old age confuses findings, and that retirement is a much better indicator. By comparing several direct marketing behaviors and related attitudes, it is evident that retirement is a better predictor of nonstore retailer use than chronological age. The general marketing implications are discussed. Â© 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. and Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc.
