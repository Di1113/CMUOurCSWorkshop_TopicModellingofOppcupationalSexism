The contact potential difference and topography distributions of a scratched Si(111) surface were measured at a nanometer‐scale resolution using a scanning Kelvin probe force microscope with a non‐contact atomic force microscope in an ultrahigh vacuum of 10−8 Pa. It was found that the work function of the scratched Si(111) surface was higher than that of the original Si(111) surface. The effect of oxygen gas adsorption on the change in the work function distribution was then investigated. The results showed that the work functions of both non‐scratched and scratched Si(111) surfaces increased with oxygen gas adsorption. The rate of increase of the work function with oxygen exposure was lower in the scratched Si(111) surface than that in the non‐scratched surface. This resulted in a lower work function of the scratched surface after prolonged oxygen exposure. Copyright © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
