We have successfully implemented a time‐resolved small‐angle light scattering apparatus with spatial averaging by means of conical lens or software processing. Averaging allows a significant reduction of measurement times and makes this technique suitable for the study of systems with very long times‐scales, from 25 Hz to many hours. We report light scattering experiments on the dissolution of polymer blends and light reflection measurement from polymer composites as examples of applications.
