This paper deals with generation efficiency maximization of wind energy conversion systems (WECS) with double output induction generator (DOIG). In the first place, to design a sliding mode controller, an apropos model of the DOIG with electronic drive in the rotor is developed. Then, conditions of maximum power generation are obtained. Finally, a sliding mode control strategy for this type of WECS is presented. The proposed strategy varies the firing angle of the electronic drive in order to set the extreme control values equal to the maximum and minimum available control action of the system. Consequently, robustness to 001Uparametric uncertainties and external disturbances is maximised. Copyright Â© 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
