An increasingly targeted functional motif in organic synthesis is the ubiquitous chiral β‐amino alcohol. A novel two‐step approach for the regio‐ and stereoselective synthesis of a wide variety of 1,2‐amino alcohols 4 involves the initial construction of chiral sulfamidates 3 from enantiopure diols 1, mediated by Burgess reagent (2, R = Me), followed by mild treatment with aqueous acid. Furthermore, the development of several new Burgess‐type reagents 2 (R = CH2Ph, CH2‐o‐NO2Ph, CH2CH=CH2, CH2CCl3) greatly extends the applications of this protocol.
