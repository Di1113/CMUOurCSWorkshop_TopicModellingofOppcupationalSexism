Biotin conjugates are of considerable value in investigating the mode of action of biologically active compounds. Two biotin conjugates related to the antifungal compound cymoxanil [1‐(2‐cyano‐2‐methoximinoacetyl)‐3‐ethyl urea] were prepared as the first step in an effort to employ display cloning to identify the compound's target site. In the first conjugate, prepared in five steps, the biotin moiety was attached at the position occupied by the ethyl group in cymoxanil. In the second conjugate, prepared in four steps, the biotin moiety was attached through the oxime functional group.
