Two major opportunities for increasing the performance of crystalline silicon solar cells involve reducing their thickness and reducing the losses associated with their front metallic grid contacts. Front grid contacted thin epitaxial silicon solar cells based on the growth of crystalline silicon films on a substrate or superstrate have been reported for many years, as have wafer‐based solar cells with alternative contact approaches. Integrating these two concepts into a single device presents an opportunity for simultaneously reducing two major loss mechanisms associated with crystalline silicon solar cells. The opportunities that exist and challenges that must be overcome in order to realize such a device are described in this paper. The design space is defined and explored by considering a wide range of possible approaches. A specific approach was chosen and used to design, grow, and fabricate a proof‐of‐concept thin epitaxial silicon solar cell with an embedded semiconductor grid as an alternative to a conventional front metallic grid. The work presented here has resulted in a thin epitaxial silicon solar cell with a 7·8% designated area conversion efficiency, well isolated contacts, negligible series resistive power loss, and less than 1% shading of the designated area.
