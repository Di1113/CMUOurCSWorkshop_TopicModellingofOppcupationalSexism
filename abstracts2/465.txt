Approximately 1 in every 1,000 bp in the human genome differs between individuals. However, only a fraction of these variations are expected to cause disease phenotypes. Such sequence variations are currently utilized for identification of mutated loci in human populations. Furthermore, genotype–phenotype association studies hold promise as prediction models for drug efficacy and may lead to customized patient care. Collectively, these activities encompass the new field of pharmacogenomics. With the potential to increase commercial value of drugs and reduce R&D costs, pharmacogenomics has taken center stage and is now awaiting approval from its audiences. The next frontier of genomics may very well be the integration of the genome map with the phenotypical characteristics of human populations. Drug Dev. Res. 49:46–53, 2000. © 2000 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.
