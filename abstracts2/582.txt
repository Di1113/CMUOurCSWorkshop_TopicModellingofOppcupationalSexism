This paper examines the effects of both anticipated and unanticipated monetary disturbances in a small open economy by taking into consideration adjustments in the banks' portfolio of earning assets. It primarily focuses on the adjustment of credit market interest rates as well as on that of the exchange rate. In particular, it is shown that the sluggish adjustment of banks' loan portfolio as well as the anticipation of a future policy change can generate perverse short‐run behaviour. © 1997 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
