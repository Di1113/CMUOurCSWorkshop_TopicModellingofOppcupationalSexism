The efficacy of esfenvalerate (84 g litre−1 EC; Asana XL) at 7.0 g AI ha−1 on broccoli was tested against the flea beetle, Phyllotreta cruciferae Goeze (Chrysomelidae: Coleoptera) and the imported cabbage worm, Pieris rapae L (Pieridae: Lepidoptera) under field conditions. Insect populations were monitored before and after treatment. Periodic sweep‐net collections and examination of the leaves in treated and untreated broccoli plots revealed mean reductions of P cruciferae levels of nearly 98% 1 week post‐application compared with untreated plots. The residual toxicity of esfenvalerate was also effective for 2 weeks in reducing population density of P rapae by 69% on broccoli leaves. The impact of esfenvalerate on feeding damage to broccoli leaves was established by counting the number of feeding holes made by P cruciferae on spring broccoli and P rapae on fall broccoli. As the leaf area ingested increased, a linear relationship was seen between the number of holes and number of insects. Results indicated that forage destruction by the two pests was significantly reduced by esfenvalerate application. Esfenvalerate was extracted from broccoli at 1 h and 1, 3, 7, 10, and 14 days post‐application for residue analysis. Residues on spring broccoli were 12.2, 5.2 and 2.9 µg cm−2 on the leaves and 0.13, 0.05 and 0.02 µg g−1 on the heads at 1 h, 1 and 3 days, respectively. Only trace levels (0.001 µg g−1) were detected in/on the heads 14 days after spraying. On the basis of half‐life (T1/2) values, persistence of esfenvalerate on spring broccoli leaves (T1/2 = 1 day) was shorter than on fall broccoli (T1/2 = 1.6 days). T1/2 values were 2.1 and 3.6 days on spring and fall broccoli heads, respectively. The implications of these residue levels on re‐entry times into treated fields are discussed.
