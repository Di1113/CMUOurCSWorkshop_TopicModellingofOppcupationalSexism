Two Shaker‐related potassium channel genes (termed tsha1 and tsha2) expressed in the CNS of trout were cloned and sequenced. The coding regions of both genes were not interrupted by introns and exhibited a high overall sequence similarity to other members of the Shaker subfamily. By computer‐assisted sequence alignments, tsha1 was identified as a fish homologue to the mammalian Kv1.2 subtype of potassium channels, whereas tsha2 did not show a preferential sequence homology but shared a uniform similarity to Kv1.1, Kv1.2, and Kv1.3. Upon heterologous expression in a mammalian glial cell line, both channels exhibited delayed rectifier current properties that differed from each other by their threshold potentials of activation and their pharamcological features: wheras the tsha1‐mediated current was efficiently blocked by submicromolar concentrations of α‐DTX but not by TEA, tsha2 was highly TEA‐sensitive, correlating well with differences in the amino acid structure of the pore outer mouth region. As revealed by RT‐PCR, Shaker‐related potassium channels were sequentially expressed during trout brain development: tsha2 was found initially at stage 34, followed by tsha1 at stage 36, whereas two other members of the Shaker family (tsha3 and tsha4) were detectable much earlier (stage 30, hatching). In the mature brain tissue, no regional specialization of Shaker channel subtype expression was noted. J. Neurosci. Res. 60:174–183, 2000 © 2000 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.
