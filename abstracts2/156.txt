Sensitivity analyses of pesticide leaching often involve a large range of simulations based on nearly identical set‐ups. Using RunMACRO it is possible to make large numbers of simulations with a minimum of exertion. Running many nearly identical model set‐ups is tedious and might introduce errors in selecting the correct values from a long range of parameter files that are appropriate to the model set‐up. RunMACRO makes the task easier and minimises the risk of errors in the generation of parameter files and model executions. Using RunMACRO, it is possible to create a suite of MACRO simulations based on a single parameter file where the range or a list of values for one to three parameters is specified. RunMACRO then creates a parameter file for each of the simulations and runs the simulations one by one. RunMACRO can easily be modified to be used with other simulation programs that use ASCII‐based parameter files and can be started from a command prompt. RunMACRO is available free to use and modify from the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland's home page.
