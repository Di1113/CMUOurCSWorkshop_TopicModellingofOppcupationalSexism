In this paper thermal performance test experiments for first figure of merit (without load) and second figure of merit (with load) of a box‐type solar cooker were conducted as per Bureau of Indian Standards. The values of second figure of merit (F2) were determined for different loads of water and the results show that F2 depends on the quantity of water loaded in a solar cooker. Therefore, it is recommended that the performance test method should specify the amount of water which is to be taken. Copyright © 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
