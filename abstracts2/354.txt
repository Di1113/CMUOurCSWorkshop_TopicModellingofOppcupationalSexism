We compared health‐related control perceptions in 115 HIV+ gay/ bisexual British men who were or were not members of an AIDS support group. Participants completed the Multidimensional Health Locus of Control Scale (MHLC). Compared to those who were not members of a support group, HIV+ men who belonged to a support group reported higher frequencies of perceptions that both oneself and powerful others (health professionals) are major determinants of one's health. Support group members also reported a lower frequency of perceptions that chance factors greatly influence one's health. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Inc.
