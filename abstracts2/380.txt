Sequential paired samples of blood and seminal fluid were obtained from a cohort of 54 HIV‐1‐infected homosexual males. The prevalence of GBV‐C/HGV RNA in the cell‐free fractions of some of these patients was determined using reverse‐transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR). To assess the effects of HIV‐1 and HCV infection upon GBV‐C/HGV RNA status, blood CD4 cell counts, HCV RNA status, and HIV‐1 proviral DNA and viral RNA titres were also determined. GBV‐C/HGV RNA was detected in 8/30 (27%) of the blood plasma samples obtained at the start of the study, and was present at a frequency of 14/64 (22%) in all the blood plasma samples tested. By contrast, GBV‐C/HGV RNA was not detected in the 26 seminal fluid samples obtained at the start of the study, including 8 samples obtained from patients for which GBV‐C/HGV RNA was detected in the corresponding blood sample. Of the samples tested for the presence of both GBV‐C/HGV and HCV RNA, there was no evidence of coinfection. Although GBV‐C/HGV RNA detection rates were significantly higher in individuals with blood CD4 cell counts greater than 200 cells per microlitre, there were no significant differences in the median blood CD4 cell counts or HIV‐1 proviral DNA or viral RNA titres observed between the GBV‐C/HGV‐positive and ‐negative individuals. The failure to detect GBV‐C/HGV RNA in seminal fluid samples obtained from this cohort would suggest that further studies need to be carried out to determine the roles of sexual transmission and of seminal fluid in GBV‐C/HGV infection.
