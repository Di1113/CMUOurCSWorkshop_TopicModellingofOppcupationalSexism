With recent advances in electrical and electronic devices, they are proliferating in the office environment. In turn, electromagnetic interference, mixing, and information leakage due to the use of wireless LAN have become problematic. Electromagnetic wave absorbers based on glass have been investigated using resistive films. In this paper, the electromagnetic wave is cut off by placing metallic wires on windowglass so that a low‐cost shielding material easily manufactured can be developed. First, only the frequency of 2.45 GHz for wireless LAN is considered in the discussion of shielding. Further, MMAC (Multimedia Mobile Access Communication Systems) has been considered as a future wireless LAN. In order to also cut off 5.2 GHz for the MMAC frequency, a method for cutting off two frequencies is proposed in which circular conductors and crossed conductors are combined. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
