Accessible in one step each, tetra‐ and pentacyclopropylcyclopentadiene (3) can be prepared from dicyclopropylacetylene (1) and n‐butyl formate (2 a) or methyl cyclopropanecarboxylate (2 b), respectively. The five cyclopropyl substituents in 3 b exert a significant donor effect on the cyclopentadienide core when this is bound to a metal center such as in 4.
