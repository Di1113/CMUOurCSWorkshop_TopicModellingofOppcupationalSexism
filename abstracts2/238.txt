Studies were undertaken on the effect of a crude (TC) and an alkaloid fraction (TA) of the leaf extracts of Tylophora conspicua on indomethacin‐induced gastric ulceration and gastric acid secretion in male albino rats. Both the TC and TA produced a dose‐dependent inhibition of gastric ulceration. At a dose level of 40 mg/kg TC and TA were more effective (TA being more potent) than propranolol in inhibiting gastric ulceration. The highest dose of the extracts used (80 mg/kg) completely inhibited gastric ulceration. Intravenous administration of the TC and TA significantly decreased acid output at low dose (20 mg/kg), medium dose (40 mg/kg) and high dose (80 mg/kg) from the peak basal of 0.54 ± 0.02 mEq/L/min to 0.49 ± 0.02 mEq/L/min, 0.35 ± 0.01 mEq/L/min and 0.21 ± 0.02 Meq/L/min respectively. 80 mg/kg of TC and TA significantly reduced the histamine (1 mg/kg) induced gastric acid secretion. The results suggest that the antiulcer activity of Tylophora conspicua might be produced by gastric acid inhibition. Copyright © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
