Green fluorescent protein (GFP)‐expressing transformants were used to investigate the effects of strobilurin fungicide azoxystrobin on Mycosphaerella graminicola infection. Azoxystrobin treatments (125 or 250 g AI ha−1) were applied at various stages of the infection process under controlled conditions. GFP transformants showed conserved in vitro sensitivity to azoxystrobin and pathogenicity. Azoxystrobin controlled over 90% of M graminicola infections when applied before or during penetration of the pathogen (15% of the incubation phase). Azoxystrobin also impaired the growth of intercellular hyphae in M graminicola post‐penetration infection stages when applied at up to 50% of the incubation phase. Incubating infections observed in treated leaves were viable, but their growth was impaired and they did not induce necrosis under controlled conditions. Reduction by half of azoxystrobin dosage had little or no effect on azoxystrobin efficiency in controlling M graminicola. The contribution of post‐penetration fungistatic effect to azoxystrobin curative properties toward M graminicola in a field situation is discussed.
