The paper traces aspects of the history and development of work in this area. It places workplace bullying on a continuum which straddles workplace homicide, violence at work, sexual harassment and the harnessing of the aggressive instincts into effective work. Thought is given to the question of which behaviours should be considered to constitute workplace bullying. A recent example of bullying in restaurant kitchens is examined in more detail. The paper concludes by looking at issues around the responsibility of individuals and organizations to understand and manage bullying at work. Â© 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
