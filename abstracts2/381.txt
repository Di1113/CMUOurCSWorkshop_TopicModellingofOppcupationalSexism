The relationship between somatotype and somatotype components with coronary artery disease (CAD) and regional adiposity was considered in 58 males (age 60.2 ± 9.4 years) undergoing investigative coronary angiography for suspected atherosclerotic CAD. Severity of CAD was determined in terms of both the degree of stenosis and the anatomical position of the lesions on the coronary arteries (myocardial score). Six patients had negative angiographic findings but three of these had impaired left ventricular function as determined by left ventriculography. The mean (±SD) somatotype of the group was 5.7 / 5.6 / 1.2 (1.7 / 1.4 / 1.0), illustrating a clear dominance of the first two somatotype components. Canonical correlation analysis showed that somatotype was not significantly related to the angiography results (P > 0.05). However, correlations between the somatotype components and the angiography results with their respective first canonical variates showed that the somatotype variate was one of high mesomorphy and low ectomorphy and the angiography variate was essentially one of a high myocardial score. After adjustment for the confounding interrelationship among the somatotype components, endomorphy was significantly correlated with abdominal circumference (r = 0.65, P < 0.001), the abdomen‐to‐hip ratio (r = 0.53, P < 0.001) and the abdominal sagittal diameter (r = 0.60, P < 0.001). Mesomorphy was not related to these indicators of android or abdominal adiposity following partial adjustment. Ectomorphy was inversely related to the indices of general and regional adiposity. This study suggests that adiposity and muscularity are important features in terms of increased CAD risk, whereas linearity is beneficial. Am. J. Hum. Biol. 12:128–138, 2000. © 2000 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.
