Low‐dimensional spin systems reveal new and unexpected physical phenomena such as distinct plateaus in the magnetization as a function of magnetic field. In this paper, we present ESR and ultrasonic measurements for the quasi‐two‐dimensional spin system SrCu2(BO3)2 and the spin‐chain compound NH4CuCl3 in magnetic fields up to 50 T. From the combination of our experimental techniques we obtain detailed information about the spin state, the magnetic excitations and their interaction with phonons. The dimerized quantum‐spin system SrCu2(BO3)2 exhibits plateaus in the magnetization and shows surprisingly strong magneto‐elastic effects as a function of temperature and magnetic field. The pronounced elastic anomalies indicate a resonant interaction between the sound wave and the magnetic excitations. In contrast to SrCu2(BO3)2 we find in NH4CuCl3 a linear relation of the c66 mode and the magnetic susceptibility.
