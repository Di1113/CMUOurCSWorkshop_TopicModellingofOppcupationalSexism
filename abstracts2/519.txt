Yttrium‐aluminum garnets, strontium and barium lanthanum gallates, lithium niobate and tantalate as‐grown crystals and doped by diffusion with rare‐earth (Nd, Dy, Er, Tm, Ho, Pr, Ce) and metal transition elements (Mn, Cr) were investigated optically and using Electron Spin Resonance method before and after gamma, electron and proton irradiation.
