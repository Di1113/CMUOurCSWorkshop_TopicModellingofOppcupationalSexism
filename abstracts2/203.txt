A niobium and pyridine salt of molybdo(vanado)phosphoric acid (see formula) leads to a catalyst that achieves excellent yield and productivity for both the conversion of propane into acrylic acid and n‐butane into maleic acid. The catalyst is active under either hydrocarbon‐rich or ‐lean reaction conditions.
