Effects of droplet size and carrier volume on foliar uptake and transport of daminozide were investigated. A constant dose of daminozide (100 µg per leaf) was applied to both primary leaves of 10‐day‐old Phaseolus vulgaris (cv Nerina) in droplet sizes of 1–10 µl and carrier volumes of 10 to 200 µl per leaf. Decreasing droplet size or increasing carrier volume decreased daminozide penetration, but increased translocation. Plotting the logarithm of the leaf surface/droplet interface area vs daminozide uptake yielded a negative linear relationship, but for translocation an optimum quadratic type relationship was obtained. Some phytotoxicity occurred at low carrier volumes and large droplet sizes. The degree of phytotoxicity was positively related to the amount of daminozide deposited per unit wetted area above 0.7 µg daminozide mm−2. Below this threshold, there was no visual evidence of phytotoxicity. At the breakpoint, the deposit covered an area of 276 mm2 on both primary bean leaf surfaces. Since the maximum in the relationship of translocation with interface area was in close agreement with the threshold amount of deposit above which phytotoxicity occurred, the inverse relationship between daminozide uptake and translocation at low interface areas was attributed to phytotoxicity.
