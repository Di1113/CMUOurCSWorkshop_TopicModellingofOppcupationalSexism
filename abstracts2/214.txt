Synthesis in molten gallium provides access to a new class of boron‐rich quaternary phases. Its first member, Tb1.8C2Si8(B12)3, represents a new structure type in which B12 icosahedra, eight Si atoms in a staggered ethane‐like arrangement, and C2 units are interconnected (see picture; red: Si, blue: B, black: C). The Tb sites have a partial occupation of about 60 %.
