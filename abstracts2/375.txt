A theoretical study was performed for the reaction of formyl cation and acetylene to give C3H+O in flames and C2H (nonclassical)+CO, both in flames and in interstellar clouds. The corresponding Potential Energy Surface (PES) was studied at the B3LYP/cc‐pVTZ level of theory, and single‐point calculations on the B3LYP geometries were carried out at the CCSD(T)/cc‐pVTZ level. Our results display a route to propynal evolving energetically under C2H (nonclassical)+CO and, consequently, accessible in interstellar clouds conditions. This route connects the most stable C3H3O+ isomer (C2‐protonated propadienone) with a species from which propynal may be produced in a dissociative electron recombination reaction. The reaction channel to produce the C3H+O evolves basically through two TSs and presents an endothermicity of 63.9 kcal/mol at 2000 K. According to our Gibbs energy profiles, the C2‐protonated propadienone is the most stable species at low–moderate temperatures and, consequently, could play a certain role in interstellar chemistry. On the contrary, in combustion chemistry conditions (2000 K) the C2H (nonclassical)+CO products are the most thermodynamically favored species. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
