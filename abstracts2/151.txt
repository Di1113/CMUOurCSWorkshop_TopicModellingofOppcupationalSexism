Many universities worldwide have their own home pages on the World Wide Web accessible to both faculty and students via user‐friendly Web browsers. Thus, education and learning resources must be developed and published on the Web to maximize the usefulness of this new technology in higher education.

This article describes the process, principles, and tools used in developing this learning module. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Comput Appl Eng Educ 7: 235–243, 1999
