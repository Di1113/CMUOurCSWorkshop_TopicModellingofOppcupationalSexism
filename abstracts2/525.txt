The semi‐closed nature of the hot‐wall‐epitaxy reactor provides a growth regime at high vapour pressures without loss of source material and offers the possibility to dope the epilayers or to form compounds during growth. The successful growth of C60 epilayers was further improved by a post‐growth in‐situ annealing process. In a series of experiments, the annealing time and temperature were varied between 10 and 60 minutes and 120°C and 220°C, respectively. The crystalline quality was analysed by high resolution X‐ray diffraction and X‐ray pole figure studies which showed an FWHM of the (111) reflex of 140 arcsec.
