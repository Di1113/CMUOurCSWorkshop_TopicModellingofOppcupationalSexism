The novel dideoxyosones 1 and 2 were shown to be precursors of the important in vivo crosslinks glucosepane and pentosidine. In 1 and 2, the lysine NÎµ atom is directly bonded to C1 of the original sugar group. The formation of these compounds proceeds through carbonyl shifts along the entire carbohydrate backbone.
