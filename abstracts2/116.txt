This paper reports the successful outcome of case studies using integrated crop management (ICM) with a view to attaining sustainable, safe and economic practices for European farmers and growers. Examples are the adoption of 6‐m conservation headlands to allow the use of selective herbicides for the control of problem weeds, whilst leaving non‐competitive species as a habitat and food source for diverse fauna; a computerised warning system for the control of Phytophthora infestans in the Netherlands, enabling fewer fungicide applications; a computer model (Colibri) which allows French farmers and advisers to forecast development of Sitobion avenae populations in order to predict optimal dates for treatment and recommendations for achieving control of Myzus persicae in peaches grown in Italy which results in least harm to beneficial insects.
