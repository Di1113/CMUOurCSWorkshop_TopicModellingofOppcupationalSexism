In this article, a software package used to design analog filters is described. This filter design tool uses Mathematica from Wolfram Research as the numerical engine. This is called MathFilters. With this package, students or practicing engineers should be able to do an analog filter design in a few seconds, giving more attention to what can be done with a filter instead of getting lost in endless cumbersome numerical calculations. Several examples showing how MathFilters works are included. This package runs on an IBM‐compatible PC under Windows95 with Mathematica 3.0. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
