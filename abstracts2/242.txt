Vanadium pentoxide (V205) was tested for its ability to induce genotoxic damage in six different organs (liver, kidney, lung, spleen, heart, and bone marrow) of mice by using the alkaline Single Cell Gel Electrophoresis (SCGE) assay. Animals were sacrificed 24 h after i.p. administration of the vanadium pentoxide of 23.0, 11.5, or 5.75 μg/g (corresponding to the LD50, 1/2 LD50 and 1/4 LD50, respectively). In all tissues and organs evaluated (except for bone marrow), V205 increased the number of cells with damage. Our results showed that i.p. injection of V205 induced DNA damage in different organs and tissues, and that this kind of damage can be observed even 24 h after treatment. The analysis of DNA migration and the distribution of DNA damage showed that there are differences in sensitivity between organs and tissues to this compound. In addition the sensitivity of SCGE assay allows the detection of long term DNA damage and the possibility to compare it in various tissues and target organs. Teratogenesis Carcinog.
