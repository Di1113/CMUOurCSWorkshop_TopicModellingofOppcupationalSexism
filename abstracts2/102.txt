An approach to the finite element method applied to the solution of stationary electromagnetic problems with axial symmetry is presented. This method is suitable for teaching electrical engineering students at the undergraduate level. The problem formulation is based solely on the direct integration of Maxwell's equations, and the approach is valid only for first‐order elements, thereby avoiding the use of an excessively complex mathematical treatment. Numerical examples illustrate the application of the proposed methodology to academic problems. Its validation is verified both by classical expressions of electromagnetic theory and by an educational finite‐element computer package. © 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
