The female reproductive system of Eupolybothrus fasciatus (Newport) (Chilopoda Lithobiomorpha) includes three types of well‐developed accessory glands, viz. large glands, small glands, and the periatrial gland. External morphology and the ultrastructural organization of these glands have been investigated by light and electron microscopy. The small and large glands are paired and have coiled ducts that open, respectively, into and externally to the genital atrium. By contrast, the periatrial gland is unpaired and is located on the ventral wall of the atrium into which it opens via several small canals. Ultrastructural features show that all three glands consist of two different types of cells: secretory cells and ductule cells. The secretary cells contain prominent secretory granules and are similar to a class of insect epidermal gland cells (class 3) organized as acini surrounding an extracellular lumen into which microvilli project. The granules, which have different morphological features in each gland, could be responsible for important differential functions such as producing a sexual attractant, providing a coating material that protects eggs laid on the ground, and contributing to a fluid that digests spermatophores. © 1996 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.
