The present study applied biometric genetic analyses to determine whether traits delineating personality disorders are influenced by gender‐specific genetic and environmental influences. The sample consisted of 681 volunteer general population twin pairs (128 monozygotic male, 208 monozygotic female, 75 dizygotic males, 174 dizygotic females, and 96 dizygotic opposite‐sex pairs). All twin pairs completed the Dimensional Assessment of Personality Pathology (DAPP‐BQ) which yields 18 basic and four high‐order dimensions of personality dysfunction. Heritability analyses showed that all dimensions except Submissiveness in males, and Cognitive Dysfunction, Compulsivity, Conduct Problems, Suspiciousness, and Self‐harm in females were significantly heritable. Sex‐by‐genotype analyses suggested that the genetic influences underlying all but four DAPP‐BQ dimensions (Stimulus Seeking, Callousness, Rejection, and Insecure Attachment) were specific to each gender, whereas the influence of the environment was found to be the same in both genders across all dimensions. All four higher‐order dimensions were also heritable across sex and in common to both genders except female dissocial personality dimensions in females, for which no heritable basis was found. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
