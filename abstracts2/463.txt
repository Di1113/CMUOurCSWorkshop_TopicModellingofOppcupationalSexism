The antimicrobial activity of Spondias mombin, Croton zambesicus and Zygotritonia crocea sourced from herbalists through an ethnobotanical survey of Egbado‐South in Ogun State in Nigeria is reported. The extracts of the leaf of Spondias mombin and the stem bark of Croton zambesicus exhibited wide spectrum antibacterial effects comparable to those of ampicillin and gentamycin. The antifungal effect of extracts of Zygotritonia crocea and Croton zambesicus were comparable to those of tioconazole. There is justification for the use of these little studied medicinal plants as antiinfective agents in traditional medicine. Copyright © 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
