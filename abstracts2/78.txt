This paper covers the use of FRP reinforcements in concrete structures. In particular, the focus of this paper will be on the state of knowledge of the durability of FRP systems as they may be applied to concrete for the purpose of strengthening or repair. The commonly available materials for repair and strengthening are glass (GFRP), aramid (AFRP), and carbon (CFRP). These materials are applied to the surface of the concrete to provide additional flexural and shear strength as well as confinement for concrete columns. Many times the repair acts as a barrier to road salts to prevent further corrosion of the underlying reinforcing steel. The application of FRP systems is discussed along with durability issues that are of particular importance and past and current research.
