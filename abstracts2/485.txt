The title compound crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P2 1 /c with four formula units in a unit cell of dimensions a = 10.814(2), b = 8.400(2), c = 11.398(4) A, β = 110.86(2)°, V = 967.5(5) A3. The crystal structure is characterized by almost exactly planar [Me2NC(NH2)Me]+cations and [O2CNMe2 ]‐ anions which are approximately perpendicular oriented to one another. The amidine N1—C and N2—C bond lengths are significantly different (1.341(7) and 1.292(7) A, respectively) but the C—O distances of the carbamate anion are equal within experimental error (1.263(6) and 1.256(6) A). An essential feature of the crystal structure are N—H —O hydrogen bonds between cations and anions.
