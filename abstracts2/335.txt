Cinnamoyl esterases play a role in the complete degradation of plant cell wall polysaccharides (xylan and pectin) by micro‚Äêorganisms. The induction and repression of a gene encoding a feruloyl esterase from Aspergillus niger (faeA), which encodes an enzyme with activity on both xylan and pectin, has been studied using activity measurements and Northern analysis. The gene was expressed on xylan as well as on pectin. The expression on xylan was much higher than on pectin, suggesting that xylan is the preferred substrate. Northern analysis demonstrated that the gene is expressed on xylose and ferulic acid. This indicates the presence of two systems for induction, a xylan/xylose specific system (XlnR) and a ferulic acid specific system. Addition of ferulic acid enhanced the induction on xylan, indicating a positive interaction between the two inducing systems.
