An investigation has been carried out into the possibilities of using polarisation methods to characterise clouds of irregular particles. Measurements were made at scattering angles around 160° in the backward direction, where it was expected that polarisation effects would be a maximum. It was found that there was no significant angular variation of any polarisation property and, as a consequence of reciprocity, the useful parameters were limited to the scattered intensities for two incident polarisation states and one cross‐polarised intensity. The only useful correlation appeared to be between cross‐polarisation and the “roundness” of the particles, although even this is dubious and in need of further exploration. The overall conclusion of the study is that the usefulness of polarisation to study clouds of randomly oriented particles may be limited.
