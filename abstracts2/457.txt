Variations in the structure of the neocortex induced by single gene mutations may be extreme or subtle. They differ from variations in neocortical structure encountered across and within species in that these “normal” structural variations are adaptive (both structurally and behaviorally), whereas those associated with disorders of development are not. Here we propose that they also differ in principle in that they represent disruptions of molecular mechanisms that are not normally regulatory to variations in the histogenetic sequence. We propose an algorithm for the operation of the neuronogenetic sequence in relation to the overall neocortical histogenetic sequence and highlight the restriction point of the G1 phase of the cell cycle as the master regulatory control point for normal coordinate structural variation across species and importantly within species. From considerations based on the anatomic evidence from neocortical malformation in humans, we illustrate in principle how this overall sequence appears to be disrupted by molecular biological linkages operating principally outside the control mechanisms responsible for the normal structural variation of the neocortex.
