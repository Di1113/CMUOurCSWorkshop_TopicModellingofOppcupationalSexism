The internet is dramatically changing the ways we learn and teach, as well as the way we interact as a society. The “same time, same place, only some people” traditional instructional method is giving way to “anytime, anyplace, anybody” educational models. This paper deals with the development of a Web‐based integrated manufacturing laboratory (WIML), which represents a virtual mini‐manufacturing corporation, whose aim is to support core manufacturing curriculum and to provide students with hands‐on experience on various manufacturing functions and effective use of manufacturing software tools. Key components of the WIML include a manufacturing tutor, a data repository, message boards, customization pages, and links to the world‐wide web. The WIML not only can stimulate students' interest in related manufacturing courses but also allow them to strengthen their computer skills and develop ability to work as a team. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
