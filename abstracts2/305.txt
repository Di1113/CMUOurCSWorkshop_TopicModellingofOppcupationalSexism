This paper discusses the situation in the USA with respect to the use by farmers of soybean varieties produced by transgenic techniques. Unlike his European counterpart, the US farmer has generally welcomed the advantages of lower inputs and enhanced pest and disease control associated with these crops. Further developments with transgenic soybeans and some other crops are discussed briefly.
