A peculiar and interesting aspect of mono‐allelic or hemizygous expression, resulting from genomic imprinting, should be a likeness or resemblance for some phenotypic traits between relatives inheriting identical active genes or domains. Although the word “likon,” a neologism, is reminiscent of the above implication, it is here proposed for use in a broader sense, namely, to designate a haplotype or part of a haplotype of an imprinted domain.
