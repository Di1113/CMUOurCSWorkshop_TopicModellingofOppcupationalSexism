The in vivo toxicities of 12 metal ions to cabbage plants have been correlated with ion‐specific physico‐chemical parameters. Several regression models were statistically significant but two different electronegativities in combination with Kaiser's electrochemical potential appeared to be the best determinants of metal ion toxicity, giving a good correlation (r2adjusted = 0.81 for 11 metal ions excluding copper, and 0.66 for all 12 metal ions).
