The majority of coronary heart disease (CHD) arises from a population with only moderately elevated risk factor levels. This study addressed the issue of whether clustering of moderately adverse levels of serum low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C), serum high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL‐C), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was detectable in children and young adults. Significant clustering of these factors was observed in young men (ages 18–24 years) (Observed/Expected [O/E] ratio = 1.5, p = 0.014), whereas in young women or children no clustering greater than due to chance was found. In males, clustering tended to increase with age. Compared to young women, young men had a higher relative intake of dietary fat, and smoked and used alcohol more often. Compared to men without risk factors, the men at risk were significantly more obese, consumed more dietary fat, and smoked more often. The highest degree of clustering was seen in the highest quartile for the subscapular skinfold thickness (O/E ratio = 2.4). In conclusion, high LDL‐C, low HDL‐C, and high DBP cluster in young adult males. The clear sex difference observed in clustering may be one of the causes for the susceptibility of adult men to CHD.
