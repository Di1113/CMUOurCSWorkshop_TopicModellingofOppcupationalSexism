In this study, we have investigated the effect of Cr substitution on the structural, magnetic and magnetoelastic properties of Fe74—xCrxCu1Nb3Si13B9 (x = 2, 4, 8, 11, 14) alloys. The samples were annealed between 450 and 600 °C for 1 h under argon atmosphere to induce various nanocrystalline fractions. The change in microstructure upon annealing were examined by the X‐ray spectrum data. A large influence of Cr content on the formation of α‐FeSi phase was observed. The magnetic field dependence of the Young's modulus (ΔE effect) was measured using the vibration reed method. The ΔE results are interpreted partly in terms of the stress relief and the reduced magnetostriction in nanocrystalline samples.
