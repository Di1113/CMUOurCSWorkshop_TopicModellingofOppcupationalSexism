This paper focuses on labour force segments defined on the basis of migrant status and gender, in terms of the impact of economic devolution related to structural adjustment policies (SAPs). In this context, gender has received attention primarily since 1990, while the migrant/non‐migrant section of the labour force remains to be tackled. Impact is calibrated for labour force segments based on gender, migration status, and both combined. Data representing all of Ecuador, and broken down by conceptually meaningful occupational and economic‐sector‐of‐employment categories, are used to observe changes over the decade of the 1980s when the impacts of SAPs were most felt. Statistics measure change between 1982 and 1990 for the population as a whole, and change in the proportion of each workforce category broken down by gender, migrant status, and both combined. The results show that females were more adversely affected than males and migrants more than non‐migrants. Concerning the combination of migration status and gender, male non‐migrants fared distinctly better than the other categories. Male migrants and female non‐migrants occupied a similar middle position. Female migrants came out as the most disadvantaged group, experiencing declines in high‐skill employment opportunities and a shift toward low‐skill and family‐based employment.© 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
