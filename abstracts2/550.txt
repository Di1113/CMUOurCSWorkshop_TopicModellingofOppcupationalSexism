Survey responses of 690 employees of a state agency were used to investigate the idea that internal mobility experiences ‘spill over’ to affect a variety of job attitudes and perceptions. Having one's internal mobility expectations met, as opposed to unmet, was associated with more favorable work‐related attitudes, a finding not moderated by demographic factors. Furthermore, employees denied a job change for ‘fair’ reasons generally exhibited more favorable work‐related attitudes than those denied for a reason construed as ‘unfair’ (e.g. sex discrimination, reverse discrimination). Demographic characteristics were again observed to moderate few relationships.
