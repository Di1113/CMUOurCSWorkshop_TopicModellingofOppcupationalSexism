The aim of this study was to investigate allelic imbalance at the major human prostate cancer susceptibility locus HPC1 at 1q24–25 and the recently reported, putative, susceptibility locus at 1p36 in prostate tumors from Swedish families with hereditary prostate cancer. We analyzed 31 prostate tumors and two lymph node metastases from 33 Swedish men in 22 families with hereditary prostate cancer for the presence of allelic imbalance using microsatellite markers D1S158, D1S422, and D1S238 for the HPC1 locus and D1S1597, D1S407, and D1S489 for the 1p36 locus. Frequencies of allelic imbalance at the two investigated loci were quite low, 3 of 27 informative tumors at the 1p36 locus and 3 of 27 informative tumors at the HPC1 locus. Interestingly, two tumors showed allelic imbalance at both loci investigated, suggesting that they may have lost a great part of chromosome 1. Taking this possibility into consideration, the specific loss of the two investigated loci may be even lower (1 of 27 informative tumors for either locus). The very low level of allelic imbalance found at HPC1 and 1p36 makes it unlikely that these loci encode genes that are acting as classic tumor suppressor genes in the initiation or progression of hereditary prostate cancer. Of the eight tumors from HPC1‐linked families, only two showed AI at the HPC1 locus, one of which had lost the wild‐type allele. © 2000 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.
