In this paper, a software tool for NC (numerical control) cutter path simulation and product visualization, 3D‐Sim, is presented. 3D‐Sim utilizes a commercial computer‐aided design (CAD) software tool, AutoCAD, to perform virtual NC verification. An NC program is interpreted and transformed into an AutoLISP program, which once loaded in AutoCAD allows the user to visualize the virtual machining operations and obtain a 3D solid model of the final part. Incorporating NC verification capability into CAD software tools not only reduces software cost but also shortens user training time. The resulting 3D solid model allows the user to visualize the final product as well as perform more detailed analysis such as measuring the dimensions. 3D‐Sim has been used in the senior/graduate level computer‐aided manufacturing (CAM) course and was well‐received by the student. This work is part of a long‐term research effort to establish an integrated manufacturing environment where students can receive rigorous training and gain hands‐on experience in collaborative manufacturing through the use of integrated computerized systems. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
