As part of product‐performance and wildlife‐hazards studies of 2% zinc phosphide (Zn3P2) steam‐rolled‐oat baits (11.2 kg ha−1) to reduce vole populations (Microtus spp) in alfalfa (Medicago sativa), we used randomly located, brushed‐dirt plots (eight ∼930−cm2 plots per 0.2‐ha enclosure) to monitor bait‐broadcast and ‐removal patterns, as well as to index vole and avian sign. Research was conducted in 18 × 0.2‐ha enclosures containing 2.5‐year‐old stands of alfalfa; a 2‐day pre‐bait (placebo baits broadcast in all enclosures) period followed by a 14‐day test‐bait period (placebo and 2% Zn3P2 baits in nine enclosures each) characterized the bait exposures. Baits were broadcast manually by two certified pesticide applicators (CPAs) using Spyker® Model‐75 spreaders. Baits that fell onto plots were counted <30 min later to assess the uniformity of bait distribution. The main statistical design was a 2 (placebo or Zn3P2 baits) × 3 (vole‐only, vole–pheasant, vole–quail exposures) × 14 (days) factorial, with days considered repeated measurements. In the six vole‐only enclosures, baits were removed from the brushed‐dirt plots and replaced with four 0% or 2% Zn3P2 baits (one per 232.6‐cm2 quadrant; 32 per enclosure); these ‘placed’ baits were then monitored daily for removal, while the surfaces of all plots were monitored daily for the presence : absence of animal/bird sign. Key results were: (a) 3.51 (±2.66) and 3.39 (±3.52) mean (±SD) baits were found on plots after pre‐bait and test‐bait broadcasts, respectively—less than the predicted 4.52 particles per 930‐cm2 plot; (b) baits ‘placed’ on plots in placebo‐baited enclosures were removed earlier than those in Zn3P2‐baited enclosures—data in agreement with observed vole mortality; and (c) species × bait interactions occurred for both the vole‐ and pheasant‐sign counts, but not quail‐sign counts—data also indirectly confirming Zn3P2‐induced mortality effects on voles and pheasants. This technique has utility for a variety of wildlife biology and chemical registration studies; although limited to arid conditions, the technique affords useful indices of broadcast calibration, bait pick‐up, as well as target and non‐target species mortality.
