A heterogeneous version of the Sharpless epoxidation: a chiral tartaric acid derivative is grafted onto the surface of silica and in the mesopores of MCM‚Äê41 (see picture). The hybrid chiral catalyst is as effective as the homogeneous complex in terms of turnover number and enantioselectivity, and the product is easily separated by simple filtration.
