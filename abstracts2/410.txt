The effectiveness of organizational learning against the difficulties faced while adapting to the Japanese market is discussed. Foreign subsidiaries are confronted with the double difficulty of adapting to their environment without losing their flexibility to respond to future changes (or ability to self‐organize) and without compromising their relationship with their head office. This paper proposes that a subsidiary must continuously review its reference models through organizational learning to overcome these difficulties and successfully respond to a changing environment. A survey of foreign subsidiaries supported the proposition and illustrated the importance of organizational learning that leads to organizational review for promoting both current adaptation and continued flexibility to self‐organize in response to future environmental changes.
