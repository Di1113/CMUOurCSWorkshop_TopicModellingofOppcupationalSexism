An intelligent computer aided instruction (ICAI) software to aid teaching, design, and optimization of thermodynamic systems is presented. The concept of articulate virtual laboratory (AVL), the role of design, the ICAI software, and the use of AVL at the US Naval Academy are described. An example is used to demonstrate that using the ICAI software is indeed an effective method to analyze and improve thermodynamic systems design. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
