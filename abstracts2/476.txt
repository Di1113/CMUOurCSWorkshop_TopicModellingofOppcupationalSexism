This article presents an elasto/viscoplastic constitutive law that accounts for the creep behaviour of soft soils, and examines the performance of an implicit time‐stepping algorithm. It is demonstrated that the update of stresses on the integration point level is most efficiently performed by using a scheme similar to that developed by Borja and Lee for plasticity.
