The effects of the antivenene fraction of an ethanol extract of Diodia scandens on some mammalian smooth muscles were investigated. On the guinea‐pig ileum, the extract was shown to be a partial agonist acting via muscarinic receptors. Acetylcholine (ACh) was 2.5 × 105 times more potent. On the pregnant guinea‐pig uterus, the extract induced concentration‐dependent increases in the force of contraction and tonus. Oxytocin and ergometrine were respectively 106 and 103 times more potent.
