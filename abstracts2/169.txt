We have developed an oral bioassay to determine the toxicity of hydramethylnon to individual workers and queens of the Argentine ant, Linepithema humile. We fed seven concentrations of hydramethylnon in suspension to individual workers or queens, determined the amount of hydramethylnon ingested and evaluated the individual ants for mortality 14 days later. At concentrations ≥0.37 g liter−1, the amount of liquid the queens ingested decreased dramatically, indicating that Argentine ant queens may detect hydramethylnon. Significantly larger volumes of the two highest concentrations of the hydramethylnon suspension were ingested by the workers, compared to the lower concentrations, suggesting that hydramethylnon may act as a feeding stimulant for the workers. Worker mortality was higher than queen mortality at the highest concentrations tested. The highest worker mortality resulted when the ants ingested 1.03 µg of hydramethylnon per mg of ant tissue. At the highest concentration (1.0 g liter−1) tested, workers ingested almost 12 times as much active ingredient per mg of body weight as did queens, suggesting that, in order to increase mortality of queens, multiple feedings must occur.
