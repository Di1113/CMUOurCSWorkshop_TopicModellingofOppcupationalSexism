This study describes a redesigned course in software quality and software process improvement. The course encompasses lectures and project work in groups. Part of this work project is done in collaboration with the local software industry. The proposed interaction pattern with industry is the main contribution of this work. This interaction model is based on research questions, presentations from industry, and subsequent presentations and document writing by students. Both the other related courses in software quality and process and other software engineering courses in which industry interaction is required can adopt this interaction model. The study also presents related work by surveying general industry interaction patterns and courses, which provide process and quality education. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
