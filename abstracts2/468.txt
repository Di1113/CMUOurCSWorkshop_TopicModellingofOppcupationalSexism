Dominant lethal studies were conducted in male and female mice with α‐asarone, the active hypolipidaemic component of Guatteria gaumeri Greenman, by per os sub‐chronic treatment (10 and 20 mg/kg, 5 days/week, for 8 weeks) and subsequent mating. α‐Asarone did not produce germinal mutations in either males or females. Epididymal sperm examination of male mice immediately after treatment failed to­reveal any alteration in sperm count on shape. No significant alterations were observed in testicular or epididymal weights or testicular histology. Copyright © 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
