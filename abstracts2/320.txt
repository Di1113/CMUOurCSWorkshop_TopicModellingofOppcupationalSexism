Construction and performance of a printed circuit board is described that is built for phase measurement in a state‐of‐the‐art phase Doppler system. Special requirements in treating phase Doppler signals are highlighted and shown to be met satisfactorily by an innovative electronic design that involves signal burst detection, multi‐bit sampling, frequency‐band narrowing, and phase signal validation based on integrated amplitude and waveform recognition. Performance of the device is measured in terms of phase accuracy for various signal‐to‐noise ratios, signal frequencies and operating temperatures. The present device is also compared with some alternative techniques for phase measurement.
