Knoop microhardness of 6H‐SiC layers grown by sublimation epitaxy was investigated. The microhardness‐load curves for all of the samples were measured and then used to extract the load‐independent microhardness values. The relationships of these values to the growth time and growth rate were studied. The microhardness‐depth profiles indicated that the layer/substrate interface region had a microhardness value that differed significantly from that of both the epi‐layer and the substrate.
