The Planck‐Benzinger methodology provides a means of determining the innate temperature‐invariant enthalpy, ΔH°(T0), thermal agitation energy, or the heat capacity integrals ∫ΔCp°(T)dT, and allows precise determination of 〈TCp〉, 〈Th〉, 〈Ts〉, and 〈Tm〉. It is a method for evaluating [ΔH − ΔH°(T0)], the heat of reaction for biologic molecules at room temperature, and provides for a better understanding of cooperative thermodynamic compensation. The Planck‐Benzinger methodology demonstrates that macromolecular interactions will always exhibit a negative value of the Gibbs free energy change at a well‐defined temperature. It can be used for determination of the thermodynamic molecular switch, where there is a change of sign in ΔCp°(T)reaction which determines the behavior patterns of the Gibbs free energy change.
