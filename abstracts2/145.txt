The objectives of Integrated Crop Management will be readily endorsed by all those working in agriculture and by those with concerns about the human or environmental effects of pesticides. The absence of demonstrable effects in man means that systems that identify benefit to human beings from this new approach will be difficult to devise; environmental and yield objectives are more likely to deliver measurable outcomes. If we fail to produce and apply a consensus‚Äêbased set of measurement objectives to ICM this management system will generate objections similar to those that apply to current schemes of risk evaluation.
