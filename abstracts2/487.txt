Many canyon rivers have channels and riparian zones composed of alluvial materials and these reaches, dominated by fluvial processes, are sensitive to alterations in streamflow regime. Prior to reservoir construction in the mid‐1960s, banks and bars in alluvial reaches of the Gunnison River in the Black Canyon National Monument, Colorado, USA, periodically were reworked and cleared of riparian vegetation by mainstem floods. Recent interest in maintaining near‐natural conditions in the Black Canyon using reservoir releases has created a need to estimate sediment‐entraining discharges for a variety of geomorphic surfaces composed of sediment ranging in size from gravel to small boulders.
