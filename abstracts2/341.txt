The fry of Clarias lazera were administered orally with 17‐α‐methyltestosterone (MT) at a dose of 100 μg/g of diet for 60 days and 17‐β‐estradiol (ED) at a concentration of 100 μg/g of diet for 90 days, respectively. Of three MT‐treated males which were individually mated with normal females, one produced all female offspring, supporting the belief that the female of C. lazera is homogametic. This MT‐treated male possessed two testes, which consisted of many lobules with numerous sperm and a few primary ova situated on the sperm duct of only one testis, showing direct evidence that this MT‐treated male was a sex reversal with female genotype. Of three ED‐treated females which were individually mated with normal males, one produced offspring in a 3♂:1♀ ratio, providing evidence that the male of C. lazera is heterogametic. This ED‐treated female possessed two ovaries, in which there were many mature and primary ova and a few cyst‐like testes situated on the surface of only one ovary, indicating direct evidence that this ED‐treated female was a sex reversal with male genotype. © 1996 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.
