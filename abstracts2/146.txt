House flies were collected from dairies in New York state and the levels of resistance to commercially available insecticide formulations were measured on painted and unpainted plywood panels. Dimethoate was ineffective on all surfaces. The wettable powder permethrin formulation was more toxic than the emulsifiable concentrate formulation. The wettable powder cyfluthrin formulation was also more toxic than the recently developed liquid formulation. In general, the best house fly control was obtained on flat latex painted plywood panels and the poorest control on gloss latex painted panels. It is highly unlikely that producers obtain adequate control with dimethoate and permethrin.
