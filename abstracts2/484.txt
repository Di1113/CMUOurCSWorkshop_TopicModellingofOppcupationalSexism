The results of obtaining TiCx crystals by the HTS method with application of Co and Ni as high‐temperature solvents are presented. The starting materials were melted in Al2O3 crucibles induction heated up to 1700°C. The obtained specimens were studied by means of optical interference microscopy, electron microscopy and X‐ray microanalysis. It was that during slow cooling of the melted Co‐Ti‐C and Ni‐Ti‐C solutions, TiCx crystallise as primary crystals and on reaching the eutectic temperature for the quasi‐binary systems crstallisation of Co‐TiCx and Ni‐TiCx took place. The obtained crystals were of cubic form and had a maximum size of 1 mm.
