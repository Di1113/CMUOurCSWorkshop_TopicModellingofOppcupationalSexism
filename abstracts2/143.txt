The photodegradation of fluchloralin by UV irradiation or sunlight in aqueous methanolic solution has been examined. In the presence of titanium dioxide five photoproducts were obtained, but only four in its absence. One photoproduct, 2, 2′‐azoxy‐bis(α,α,α‐trifluoro‐6‐nitro‐p‐toluidine) is reported for the first time as a metabolite of fluchloralin. In natural sunlight the rate of degradation was higher than in UV light and titanium dioxide had almost no effect on the rate of degradation.
