Light scattering‐based laser particle analyzers have found wide use in powder technology and many‐particle systems. It is very important that the photodetector of the analyzer is in good alignment with the incident laser beam, otherwise errors will occur. In this paper, the influences of misalignment on the final results of measurements are discussed.
