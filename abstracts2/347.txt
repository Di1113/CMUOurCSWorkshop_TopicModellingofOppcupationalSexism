The correlation between triacylglycerols containing conjugated diene fatty acyl moieties and pheromone aldehydes in the sex pheromone glands of females of Manduca sexta was investigated. Females decapitated 15 h after adult emergence neither called nor produced pheromone during the natural period of pheromone production on the subsequent two nights. However, these females could be stimulated to produce sex pheromone for prolonged periods by repeated injection of synthetic pheromone biosynthesis activating neuropeptide (PBAN). Gas chromatographic analysis of methanolysis products of lipids extracted from the pheromone glands of decapitated and intact females showed no differences in the amounts of fatty acyl precursors of pheromone. High performance liquid chromatographic analysis of the triacylglycerols containing conjugated diene analogues of the pheromone components (diene TG), obtained 24 and 48 h after decapitation, showed that the total amounts of these components were not affected by decapitation. The amounts of all diene TG peaks declined significantly when decapitated females were stimulated to produce pheromone during a 7 h period by repeated injection of PBAN at 3 h intervals but recovered when pheromone production subsided. These results indicate that PBAN induces liberation of pheromone precursors from the triacylglycerols during pheromone biosynthesis but does not induce replenishment of this storage pool. © 1996 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.
