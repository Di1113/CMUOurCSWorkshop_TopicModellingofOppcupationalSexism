In a legal environment that prohibits discrimination in hiring, employee selection decisions should generally not be discriminatory in either the process or the final choice. Multi‐criteria group decision support offers methodology to committees involved in hiring decisions that can improve the chances for non‐discriminatory selection processes. The legal requirements for non‐discriminatory hiring decisions raise new challenges for both multi‐criteria decision aid methodology and the way it is applied in a group setting. We investigate these issues in the context of an actual faculty selection decision at a major university in the USA. Our observations can be generalized to committee‐based employee selection decisions where laws apply that forbid discrimination in hiring. Copyright © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
