This paper presents an efficient algorithm for scheduling a single‐category work force on 4‐day or 3‐day work weeks. Employees work 4 or 3 days each week, have A out of every B weekends off, and work no more than 5 consecutive days in a work stretch on 4‐day work weeks and no more than 4 days in a work stretch on 3‐day work weeks. Such conditions often prevail in 7‐day‐a‐week organizations such as hospitals, manufacturing plants, and retail stores. We determine the minimum number of workers required to satisfy the scheduling constraints under any pattern of daily requirements. Then we present the algorithm for assigning days off for each worker, thereby determining the work schedules. We show that the algorithm, by construction, will necessarily satisfy the scheduling constraints. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Naval Research Logistics 45: 839–853, 1998
