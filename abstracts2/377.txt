The response of buried continuous pipeline to tranverse Permanent Ground Deformation (PGD) has been studied by a number of investigators over the past few years. Herein the numerical results by O'Rourke (1988) and Suzuki et al. as well as analytical results by O'Rourke are compared. It is shown that the numerical results specifically the peak tensile strain induced in the pipeline for moderate to large widths of the PGD zone (width ⩾30 m) agree reasonably well, and compare favourably with existing simplified, closed form, analytical results. However, the peak compressive pipe strains differ as well tensile strains for small widths of the PGD zone (width W≈10 m). New numerical results are presented which clarify these differences. In addition, an improved analytical model is introduced. Using information from PGD case histories primarily from Japan, the improved analytical model is shown to match reasonably well with numerical results. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
