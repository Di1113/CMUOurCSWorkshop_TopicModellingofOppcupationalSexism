Three experiments employing male and female Syrian hamsters (aged 1, 2, and 8–10 months), male Sprague‐Dawley rats (aged 1, 2, and 10 months) and male C57Bl mice (aged 2, 7, 13, and 29 months) examined the effects of age and sex on Mg2+‐dependent and Ca2+, Mg2+‐dependent ATPase activity in the Harderian gland. Significant differences due to age and sex were observed in the hamsters and rats but not with age in mice. Generally, male hamsters had significantly higher Mg2+‐dependent and Ca2+, Mg2+‐dependent (exception at one timepoint) ATPase activity than did females. Age‐matched male and female rats had similar values of Mg2+‐dependent ATPase activity, but males had significantly higher Ca2+, Mg2+‐dependent ATPase activity than females at 2 months of age. © 1996 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.
