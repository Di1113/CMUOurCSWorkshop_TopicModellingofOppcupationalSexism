Selective vulnerability of certain brain regions which is characteristic of Wernicke ‐ Korsakoff syndrome (WKS), is still unexplained. The objective of this study was to measure the activity of transketolase (TK), in 9 regions of five normal human brains at post‐mortem to determine if there is a relationship between regional distribution of TK and regions susceptible to damage in WKS. The brain regions studied included cerebellum, pons, thalamus, corpus callosum, occipital lobe, parietal lobe, frontal lobe, caudate nucleus and mamillary body. Regardless of whether the results were expressed in terms of tissue wet weight or protein content, there was a signfiicant regional distribution of TK activity within the brain regions (F Prob < 0.001, ANOVA). Further anaysis using multiple comparison of pairs of areas indicated that TK activity was significnatly higher in the mamillary body compared to all other regions when expressed in terms of wet weight (P < 0.05). There is no obvious correlation apart from the finding that the highest TK activity was encountered in the mamillary body, a structure invariably afflicted in WKS.
