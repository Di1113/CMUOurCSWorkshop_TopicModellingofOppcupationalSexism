The condensation reaction of the enolate of methyl acetate with formaldimine to afford a β‐lactam was studied using the MP2‐FC/6‐31+G* level of theory taking into account the electrostatic effect of the solvent by means of a self‐consistent reaction field continuum model. The reaction is a stepwise process with three main steps: the formation of the C3(SINGLE BOND)C4 bond, the closure of the β‐lactam ring, and the elimination of the methoxide ion. The formation of the C3(SINGLE BOND)C4 bond is rate determining and according to our calculations is not a reversible step. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. J Comput Chem 19: 1826–1833, 1998
