The effect of agronomic doses of three suspension concentrate formulations and two anionic surfactant adjuvants on the solubilisation and sorption characteristics of triticonazole fungicide in a loamy clay soil was investigated. Soil sorption of [14C]triticonazole alone, in the formulations, and in the presence of increasing doses of formulation additives was measured using the classical batch equilibration technique. Triticonazole solubilisation in water‐formulation systems was also evaluated using a batch procedure, and sorption of the formulation aqueous phases on soil was examined. Solubilisation of triticonazole in the formulation systems occurred in excess of the solubility in water (Sw). This was attributed to triticonazole association with surfactant monomers. Sorption isotherms of triticonazole with diluted surfactants and other formulation additives were similar to that of triticonazole alone. We concluded that in soil‐formulation systems, triticonazole solubilisation in excess of the Sw may increase the amount available in soil solution for plant absorption. However, triticonazole molecules preferentially associated with the soil surfaces, and the presence of diluted amounts of the formulation adjuvants would not significantly affect the soil sorption process.
