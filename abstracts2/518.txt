The currents expressed by rat skeletal muscle sodium channel α–subunit in frog oocytes show a bimodal inactivation, corresponding to a modal gating behaviour, comprising a fast inactivating mode and a slower inactivation mode with an inactivation time constant about by one order of magnitude higher. The effect of the β1–subunit on the kinetics of inactivation of these two gating modes was investigated by analysing the inactivaiton time constants of the sodium currents expressed by the α‐subunit and by the combination of α– and β1–subunits. Co–expression of β1–subunit causes a three–fold reduction of the propensity of sodium currents to inactivate in the slow mode, without significantly changing of the kinetics of inactivation in either mode.
