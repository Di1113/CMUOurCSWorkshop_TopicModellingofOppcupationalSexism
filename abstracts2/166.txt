The steady‐state performance of heat pumps can be predicted from the cooling capacity and the input power required by the system. The key element for such an analysis is the “map‐based” modeling approach which requires that the performance characteristics of a heat pump and its components, the compressor, evaporator, condenser, and flow control devices be expressed as simple algebraic functions. This study explores the efficacy of a math‐package, MATLAB and “map‐based” modeling approach to predict off‐design‐operating performance of a single air‐source heat pump operating in the cooling mode. Also, the paper describes a useful tool that can be used to enhance students' capability to analyze projects involving thermodynamic systems. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
