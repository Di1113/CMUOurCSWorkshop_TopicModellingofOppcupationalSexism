ARTS in chemistry: Aryloxymethyl hyponitrites provide the first aryloxyl radical thermal sources (ARTS) which generate a well‐defined flux of aryloxyl radicals (ArO.) at room temperature [Eq. (1)]. These novel compounds can be used for quantitative studies on reactions of ArO. with biomolecules, as exemplified by the PhO.‐mediated oxidation of human low‐density lipoprotein.
