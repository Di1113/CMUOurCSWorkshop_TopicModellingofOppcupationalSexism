The fumigant toxicity of the essential oil component p‐cymene was assessed against Western Flower Thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis. F occidentalis adult females, first‐ and second‐instar larvae and eggs were exposed for 2, 24 and 48 h to combinations of three p‐cymene doses and two carbon dioxide levels (ambient, 10%). Additional experiments were conducted on F occidentalis adult females with lower carbon dioxide levels (ambient, 2%, 4%, 6%) applied in combination with p‐cymene. Combined applications of p‐cymene and carbon dioxide were found to increase significantly the fumigant toxicity of p‐cymene against both adult female and larval thrips, but not thrips eggs. An increase in exposure time also led to an increase in adult and larval mortalities in both the p‐cymene alone and combined treatments. These results indicate that by combining applications of the essential oil component, p‐cymene, with increased carbon dioxide, it may be possible to achieve toxicity levels similar to those of standard chemical fumigants.
