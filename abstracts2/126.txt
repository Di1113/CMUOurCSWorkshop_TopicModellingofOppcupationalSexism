Hyaliodes vitripennis (Say) is a univoltine indigenous predacious mirid. It has been reported in several orchards where IPM programmes are used. It is a generalist, and feeds on phytophagous mites in addition to other arthropods. In Quebec, a foliar application of imidacloprid, deltamethrin or lambda‐cyhalothrin is used at least once per season to manage arthropod pests such as leafhoppers and leaf‐eating caterpillars. Meanwhile, several applications of metiram, flusilazole, myclobutanil and mancozeb are made to control apple scab [Venturia inaequalis (Cooke) Winter]. In laboratory trials, comparison of lethal concentrations of the three insecticides against H vitripennis nymphs and adults showed no significant difference. However, when lethal concentrations were compared between two growth stages for each insecticide, a significant difference was noted between adults and nymphs treated with lambda‐cyhalothrin, adults being more susceptible than nymphs. No such difference could be detected for imidacloprid or deltamethrin. When LC50 values were compared with the manufacturer's label rates, deltamethrin and imidacloprid were toxic to the nymphs and adults, and lambda‐cyhalothrin was slightly toxic to the nymphs and moderately toxic to the adults. Among the fungicides evaluated in the laboratory, myclobutanil showed moderate toxicity to adults at the manufacturer's label rate. The remaining fungicides had no toxic effects to adults or nymphs, even at four times the manufacturer's label rate.
