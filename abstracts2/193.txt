A rapid technique has been developed to determine the glycogen content of yeast on an individual cell basis using a combination of image analysis technology and staining of yeast cells with an I2:KI solution. Changes in mean cellular glycogen content during alcoholic fermentation have been reported using this technique. The glycogen content of stored brewer's yeast is heterogeneous compared to freshly propagated yeast which have a more uniform distribution of glycogen. Analysis of the distribution of yeast glycogen during fermentation indicates that a fraction of yeast cells do not dissimilate glycogen. Therefore, conventional analysis of the mean glycogen content of yeast used to inoculate fermentations is of limited use, unless information regarding the proportion of cells which utilize glycogen is known. Analysis of the distribution of glycogen within a yeast population can serve as a useful indicator of yeast quality.
