The effect of carbachol on the spontaneous release of 3H‐GABA was investigated on rat globus pallidus (GP) slices. Carbachol dose‐dependently enhanced the release of 3H‐GABA. The carbachol (5 × 10−4 M) induced 3H‐GABA release is mediated by muscarinic receptors since atropine (10−6 M), pirenzepine (10−6 M) and AF‐DX384MS (10−6 M) abolished the effect. An indirect carbachol effect mediated by dopaminergic and glutamatergic afferents was ruled out since the effect was not blocked by either D1 (SCH23390 10−6) and D2 (sulpiride 10−5 M) receptor antagonists or by ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists (CNQX 10−6 M and 10−5 M, MK801 10−6 M). A direct effect is further evidenced by the persistence of the carbachol effect in the presence of tetrodotoxin (5 × 10−7 M). Surprisingly the carbachol effect was not abolished by lowering the Ca2+ concentration of the superfusion medium or by increasing concomitantly the Mg2+ concentration. The involvement of a GABA transporter can partially explain this latter result, as nipecotic acid (10−3 M) blocked the effect by only 50%. Carbachol stimulated the accumulation of 3H‐phosphoinositides in pallidal slices, an effect that was antagonized by atropine (10−6 M), pirenzepine (10−6 M), and AF‐DX384MS (10−6 M). These results suggest that the activation of muscarinic receptors localized on striatopallidal terminals stimulates the release of GABA in the globus pallidus through inositol phosphate hydrolysis.
