The basic principles of the contactless growth of crystals from the vapor in combination with the process of low‚Äêsupersaturation nucleation are discussed. The mathematical formulation of the morphological stability criterion in vapor growth systems is given and its implications for contactless growth technique are analysed. A diagram for selection of proper temperature conditions for growth of CdTe crystals is presented.
