This paper presents the structure and use of Dr. Layer, a computer program designed to provide students a simulation/visualization environment for studying linear and nonlinear wave propagation behavior in layered soil media. To support student‐based exploration, Dr. Layer uses “live” modeling, i.e., modeling in which computation, interaction, and visualization occur simultaneously. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
