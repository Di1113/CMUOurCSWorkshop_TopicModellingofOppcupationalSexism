Biodegradable polymer poly‐D,L‐lactide‐polyethylene glycol (PLA‐PEG) was synthesized with stannous octoate (SnOc2) as catalyst by a cationic ring‐opening polymerization. The molecular weight of PLA‐PEG is the highest at a content of 0.1% SnOc2. The PLA‐PEG microspheres carrying protein were prepared by a solvent evaporation composite emulsion technique with a narrow size range (1–2 μm). The sizes of PLA‐PEG microspheres increased with the increase of the molecular weight of PLA‐PEG. The PEG in PLA‐PEG (10%) significantly improved the size control of the microspheres of the PLA family as a drug carrier matrix. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) aqueous solution was used as dispersion medium for microsphere preparation. The concentration of the PVA solution can affect the size of the PLA‐PEG microspheres. The differential scanning calorimetry data showed that the PLA‐PEG microspheres can efficiently encapsulate the protein and that the crystalline of the microspheres carrying protein was lower than that of the nonprotein‐loading microspheres. The amount of protein carried in the PLA‐PEG microspheres was related to the nature of the protein itself. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. J Appl Polym Sci 66: 583–590, 1997
