Insecticidal δ‐endotoxin proteins, degraded from parasporal crystals by protease, were recovered by a simple procedure using heat treatment, solubilization, and ultrafiltration of a fermentation broth of Bacillus thuringiensis subsp kurstaki HD‐1. A 68 kDa insecticidal protein was obtained and characterized by SDS‐PAGE. The procedure described gave a nearly quantitative recovery of toxicity. Furthermore, bioassay results on larvae of the diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) showed that the 68 kDa δ‐endotoxin fraction (P1) was the principal insecticidal component to this target insect. A similar molecular mass polypeptide P2 (65 kDa) which was solubilized together with P1 from the parasporal crystals, gave relatively low mortality.
