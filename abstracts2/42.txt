In this study, we compared the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory—2 (MMPI‐2) performance of male university students and incarcerated criminal offenders in Mexico. Our aim was to determine whether the MMPI‐2 can effectively differentiate between these two distinct groups on scales that are reflective of antisocial behaviors. Our expectations were highly confirmed across the three sets of scales that we considered: the validity and clinical, content, and supplementary scales. Criminal offenders obtained higher or more pathological scores on such scales as Infrequency (F), Schizophrenia (Sc), MacAndrew Alcoholism Scale (MAC‐R), Fears (FRS), and so on. Overall, these findings support further research with such target populations as prison inmates in Mexico and other countries in Latin America. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
