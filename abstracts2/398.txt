The Danish Prostate Symptom Score (DAN‐PSS) is a new questionnaire for the assessment of lower tract urinary symptoms (LUTS), which claims to be able to predict bladder outlet obstruction. We evaluated the ability of the DAN‐PSS to assess LUTS, to predict obstruction, and to predict treatment outcome in men with symptomatic uncomplicated BPH. Twenty‐five consecutive men with symptomatic uncomplicated BPH filled in the AUA symptom score and the DAN‐PSS and underwent uroflowmetry and pressure‐flow studies prior to transurethral prostatic resection (TURP). Patients were reevaluated 4 days and 8 months after surgery. AUA score and DAN‐PSS both assessed LUTS and were sensitive to symptom changes after therapy. Compared to pressure/flow studies, neither score correlated with bladder outlet obstruction. Peak urinary flow, however, correlated significantly with obstruction. None of the diagnostic tools used was able to improve patient selection for surgical treatment. The DAN‐PSS is a valid and sensitive questionnaire for the assessment of LUTS. It is not able, however, to predict bladder outlet obstruction. In men with uncomplicated BPH, urodynamic evaluation of bladder outlet obstruction did not improve the subjective outcome of TURP.
