The purpose of this survey was to describe the job setting, professional activities, and satisfaction of maternal‐fetal medicine (MFM) subspecialists and to compare these with previous surveys. A questionnaire was mailed to members of the Society of Perinatal Obstetricians (SPO). The results were compared to a similar survey in 1986. Of 1,352 members, 58% responded. In comparison to 1986, there was an increase in percentage of women (25%); a decrease in university hospital‐based faculty (55%); and an increase in community hospital‐based salaried physicians (23%) and private practice (15%). The distribution of professional time changes with an increase in clinical care, a decrease in teaching and research. The annual number of procedures increased for ultrasound and genetics and decreased for gynecologic procedures. Since 1986, there have been significant changes among MFM subspecialists in job setting, allocation of professional time, and number and types of procedures. Job satisfaction remains high. J.
