Recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein‐2 (rhBMP‐2) was encapsulated in biodegradable poly(DL‐lactide‐co‐glycolide) (PLGA) capsules to regenerate bone by controlling the release rate of rhBMP‐2. The rhBMP‐2/PLGA capsules containing 12 μg of rhBMP‐2 were implanted in seven 15‐mm segmental defects of rabbits radii to examine the healing capacity of the rhBMP‐2/PLGA capsules. For the control group, four segmental defects were left empty and two were implanted with ghost PLGA capsules. Healing of the defects was followed for 24 weeks and periodically evaluated by radiographs and histological examination. Mechanical testing was applied to three regenerated bone samples at 24 weeks postoperatively when the mature cortex was observed. Mechanical properties of regenerated bone were not significantly different from normal intact bone statistically. Histologically, the rhBMP‐2/PLGA capsules disappeared completely during the process of bone regeneration. These results increased possibilities for clinical application of rhBMP‐2/PLGA capsules. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. J Biomed Mater Res, 50, 191–198, 2000.
