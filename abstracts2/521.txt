Absorption and additional absorption of LiNbO3 crystals doped with Cr3+ during growth or by diffusion process were investigated before and after γ‐irradiation with a dose of 105 Gy and also before and after proton irradiation with a fluency of 1014 cm‐2. It was found that chromium ions may be introduced into LiNbO3 crystals also as Cr2+. ESR measurements of Cr:LiNbO3 crystals irradiated by γ‐rays and electrons were performed. Paramagnetic peak after γ and electron irradiation was observed, which vanishes after annealing at 400°C for 3h both in optical and ESR spectra. Mn2+ lines were also observed, which diminish after electron irradiation only.
