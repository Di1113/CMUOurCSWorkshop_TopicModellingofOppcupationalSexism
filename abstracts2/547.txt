We conducted a questionnaire survey at a major company in 1989 to explore the relationship between male employees' work‐setting features and reasons for drinking. A factor analysis of 20 work‐setting items resulted in four main work‐setting factors: quality of work, relationships with superiors, work quantity/environment and relationship with colleagues. A multiple regression analysis was carried out to test the relationships between these four work‐setting factors and reasons for drinking. The respondents who drank socially in business situations were more satisfied with their relationships with their superiors and colleagues, but this drinking behaviour did not significantly correlate with the quality of work and work quantity/environment factors. Social drinking in business situations appears to promote a friendly relationship with colleagues and superiors in Japanese companies. Those who drank to reduce frustration were less satisfied with all the four work‐setting factors. It appears that drinking is more likely to occur to reduce the strain associated with work overload. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
