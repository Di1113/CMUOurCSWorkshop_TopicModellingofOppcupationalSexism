The steady flow of an Oldroyd‐B fluid between two porous concentric circular cylinders is studied. The equation of motion and the constitutive equations form a system of non‐linear ODEs that is solved numerically, and in a few cases the numerical results are compared with a known analytical solution. We consider the effect of the non‐Newtonian nature of the fluid on the drag and on the boundary layer structure near the walls. Numerical computations show the effect of the non‐Newtonian quantities on the velocity and on the shear stress as the dimensionless parameters are varied. © by 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
