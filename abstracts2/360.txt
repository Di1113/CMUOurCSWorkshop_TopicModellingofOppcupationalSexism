Two neem preparations and the bitter‐tasting synthetic chemical denatonium benzoate were tested in the laboratory as antifeedants against the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella L. The effects of the three materials on Cotesia plutellae (Kurdjumov), a hymenopteran parasitoid of ­P xylostella, were also recorded. All three materials significantly reduced the food consumption of ­P xylostella larvae. Parasitoid cocoons were formed on approximately half of those larvae which had been exposed to female C plutellae, regardless of antifeedant treatment, but emergence of adult parasitoids from the cocoons was significantly reduced by antifeedant treatment. In terms of food consumption and mortality of unparasitised P xylostella larvae, and emergence of adult C plutellae, the effect of each antifeedant preparation was directly related to the concentration of material used, but the effects of the neem preparations were greater than those of denatonium benzoate. However, no adult P xylostella emerged on any antifeedant treatment, therefore some of the parasitoids survived antifeedant treatments which were fatal to the unparasitised hosts.
