This paper provides a test of the effect of proxy contests on managerial job security. We investigate senior executive turnover rates in the presence/absence of proxy fights associated with listed companies in Taiwan during the period 1984â€“91. The findings demonstrate that top management turnover is closely related to the incidence of proxy fights, lending support to the job security hypothesis.
