The direct effect of acetylcholine on the activation of the corpora allata (CA) was investigated in the adult male loreyi leafworm, Mythimna loreyi. Acetylcholine, in the presence of the choline esterase inhibitor physostigmine (50 μM), elicited a stimulatory effect on juvenile hormone acids (JHAs) release from the CA. Maximum effect was obtained at concentrations of 10 and 50 μM. Repeated administration of 10 μM acetylcholine on the same CA did not elicit similar stimulatory effect. Since JHA release can be significantly activated by carbachol and not by nicotine, this cholinergic effect is likely to belong to the muscarinic type. The effect of acetylcholine was significantly antagonized by gallamine triethiodide (M2 antagonist) and 4‐DAMP (M3 antagonist), pirenzepine (M1 antagonist), and tropicamide (M4 antagonist) were ineffective. It is concluded that in the adult male M. loreyi, the cholinergic regulation of CA is most likely via M2 and M3 muscarinic receptors.Arch. Insect Biochem.
