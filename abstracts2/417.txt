Mapping distribution channels against a company's defined market segments provides a methodical way of addressing short‐term tactical and long‐term strategic decisions, and guides the user in the focused use of CI data collection. This mapping technique is called CTM™ or Channels‐To‐Market™. It is an analytical tool based on the principle that there must be a focus on events occurring at individual market segment and distribution channel intersections, and that those events support business decision‐making at tactical and strategic levels throughout and beyond an entire business life cycle. The result is the application of CI data points to business scenarios and actual corporate business decisions. This article is a brief overview discussion concentrated on the application of the CTM™ Map and methodology, and how it makes CI tangible and “actionable” by focusing and linking the organization's CI collection efforts to relevant marketing, sales, strategic planning, and other deliverables that provide direct return on investment (ROI). © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
