We present an educational software package MuDSPDEMO, created with the idea of supporting a graduate course on multirate digital signal processing. The package was implemented in MATLAB v. 5.2 and uses a graphical user interface or GUI tool available in MATLAB. The main demonstrations include representation of discrete signals, decreasing the sampling rate, increasing the sampling rate, cascade of decimation and interpolation, filters and filters banks. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
