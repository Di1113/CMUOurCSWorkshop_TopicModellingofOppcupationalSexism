The effect of temperature on the optical absorption spectra and optical parameters is investigated for pure TGS and TGS doped with Cu2+ ions. Absorption measurements cover the range from room temperature to about 355 K in the energy range 3‐5.5 eV. The temperature dependence of the band gap Eg(T) reveals an anomaly at the phase transition temperature for both pure and Cu2+‐doped TGS crystals. In the region of the absorption edge the absorption coefficient is found to display Urbach‐rule behaviour. The characteristic Urbach parameters are determined and their temperature dependence is investigated.
