The potential impact of free electromagnetic analysis software on high frequency design education is described. Typical topics that can be effectively taught and illustrated using this software are outlined. Important among these topics are techniques for effectively casting large and difficult problems into simpler forms that can be analyzed using existing resources, a skill that is important regardless of the actual resources available. Both graduate and undergraduate topics are described. Undergraduate topics emphasize establishing an early interest and excitement so that high frequency design can compete effectively with computers and digital design in gaining a student's enthusiastic attention. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
