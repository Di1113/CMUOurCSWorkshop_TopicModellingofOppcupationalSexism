The stem bark of Daniellia oliveri was screened phytochemically and a methanol extract prepared.­Condensed tannins, saponins, cyanogenetic and cardiac glycosides were identified in the crude drug. The cardiac glycoside components in the methanol extract were precipitated with acetone to yield a reddish‐brown residue. The n‐butanol soluble fraction of an aqueous solution of this residue tested positive for cardiac glycosides and was shown by TLC to contain steroidal compounds. This fraction was subjected to pharmacological studies on isolated rat bladder smooth muscle. It had no effect on purinergic neurotransmission but was a noncompetitive antagonist for muscarinic receptors. Copyright © 1999 John­Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
