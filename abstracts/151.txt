The possible role of endogenous monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitory activity (tribulin) in the regulation of pineal levels of N‐acetylserotonin and melatonin was investigated in normotensive (WKY) and in spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) rats, with and without 2 h of cold‐immobilisation stress (CIS). The MAO‐B inhibitory activity was similar in all groups. The basal level of the MAO‐A inhibitory activity was significantly higher in SHR than WKY rats. CIS increased the MAO‐A inhibitory activity and serotonin in WKY but not SHR rats. The initial content of N‐acetylserotonin, melatonin, and serotonin did not differ in the two groups, and there were no differences in stress‐induced melatonin augmentation. However, after the stress was induced, the level of N‐acetylserotonin was higher in SHR rats. Endogenous MAO‐A inhibitory activity may have a role in stress induced production of N‐acetylserotonin and melatonin in normotensive rats, but not in hypertensive animals.
