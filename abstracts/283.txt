We fabricated field effect transistors (FETs) using door (TTF, TMTSF) and acceptor (TCNQ) molecules, and we investigated the change of conductivity in the charge transfer (CT) complex layer by applying gate voltages. Several types of FETs having TTF/TCNQ and TMTSF/TCNQ layered structures were examined. The stacked‐layer FET showed a large transconductance compared with a single‐layer FET. The experimental results demonstrate that the CT complex layer formed between donor and acceptor films mainly works as a conduction channel. Furthermore, the change in the degree of charge transfer corresponding to conductivity change was confirmed by infrared absorption spectra. © 2000 Scripta Technica, Electr Eng Jpn, 134(1): 10–16, 2001
