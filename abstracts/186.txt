Nucleotide pool imbalances have been reported to affect the fidelity of DNA replication and repair in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. We have reported previously that the mutagen‐hypersensitive thymidine kinase (TK)–deficient Friend erythroleukemia (FEL) cells (subclones 707BUF and 707BUE), have a more than sixfold increase in the dCTP:dTTP pool ratio when compared to that of wild‐type, TK‐positive (TK+) clone 707 cells. In this study we present the results of an investigation of the effect of the dCTP:dTTP pool imbalance on the accuracy of DNA replication within 707BUF cells. We examined the spontaneous mutation spectra occurring at the adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (aprt) locus within clone 707 (TK+) and 707BUF (TK−) FEL cells. Mutations recovered at the aprt locus in FEL cells comprised: base substitutions (43:73), frameshifts (14:13.5), and deletions (43:13.5) [clone 707 (TK+):707BUF (TK−), respectively, expressed as percentages]. A comparison of the mutation spectra obtained for the two cell lines did not reveal any significant increase in misincorporation of dCTP, the nucleotide in excess, in 707BUF (TK−) cells, during DNA replication synthesis. These data suggest that the dCTP:dTTP pool imbalance does not alter the fidelity of DNA replication synthesis in 707BUF (TK−) FEL cells. Rather, the predominance of GC → AT transitions (53%) in the 707BUF (TK−) spectrum may reflect a reduced efficiency of repair by uracil DNA glycosylase of uracil residues within these cells. Environ.
