Continuous flow analysis (CFA) is suitable for rapid and reliable determination of free FeIII in organic‐free, UV‐oxidized seawater when used in conjunction with an extrapolation method that predicts the steady‐state potentials of an FeIII chalcogenide glass ion‐selective electrode (ISE) by using initial data associated with a step‐wise change in aFe3+. It is shown that the CFA technique yields a Nernstian response of a 30 mV per decade change in aFe3+ in saline citrate buffers in the range of 10−22 to 10−1 M Fe3+. Validation of the CFA technique in organic‐free, UV‐oxidized seawater has demonstrated that the response of the FeIII ISE is internally consistent with the well‐known inorganic speciation equilibria occurring in natural seawater. © 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
