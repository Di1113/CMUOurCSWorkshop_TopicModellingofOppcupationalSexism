Twelve herbicides, representatives of two chemical groups, substituted phenoxyalkanoic acids and s‐triazines, were tested for their inhibitory effect on the glucuronidation of 4‐nitrophenol (4‐NP), phenolphthalein (PPh) and 4‐methylumbelliferone (4‐MU) by rat liver microsomes. One millimole MCPA, ametryn and cyanazine significantly decreased PPh UDP‐glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) activity, while propazine was found to be a most potent inhibitor of 4‐NP glucuronidation. Concentrations of 0.1 mM dichlorprop and cyanazine were still inhibitory against PPh‐UGT. The inhibition of 4‐MU glucuronidation by the herbicides was low and not specific. As a whole, s‐triazine derivatives were more inhibitory than the substituted phenoxyalkanoic acids. Kinetic studies with propazine revealed a non‐competitive type of inhibition towards the acceptor substrate 4‐NP, with an apparent Ki value of 0.540 mM. With ametryn, an uncompetitive type of inhibition against PPh and a mixed type of inhibition towards UDPGA were found, with apparent Ki values of 0.330 mM and 0.380 mM, respectively.
