The giant magnetoimpedance effect (GMI) in amorphous and nanocrystalline Fe86Zr7B6Cu1 ribbons has been studied in a wide frequency interval (500 kHz–6 GHz) as a function of microstructure. Selected ribbons have been submitted to conventional and current annealing to induce the amorphous‐to‐nanocrystalline transformation. A novel technique exploiting a network analyser has been used to evaluate GMI in the high‐frequency range (30 MHz–6 GHz). GMI ratios as high as 83% have been found in nanocrystalline samples. A different behavior in the GMI effect has been observed for frequency higher than 100 MHz.
