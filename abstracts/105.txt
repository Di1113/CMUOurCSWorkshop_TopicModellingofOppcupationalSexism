Based on the analytical method, the influence of the cross‐phase modulation effect on WDM optical packet‐switching networks is investigated. We show that the input optical power, channel spacing, and traffic characteristics impact the XPM effect that eventually influences the network performance. The results are useful for designing optical packet networks. © 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Microwave Opt Technol Lett 32: 170–174, 2002.
