SiO2 xerogel doped with Cu2+ and Co2+ has been prepared by the sol–gel method. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra and absorption spectra of the samples have all been investigated. The absorption spectra of Cu2+‐doped silica xerogel present a red shift as comparing with that of the un‐doped silica xerogel. Also, the emission spectra of Cu2+‐doped samples present a red shift with the increasing concentration of Cu2+ (color range from 450 to 470 nm). Very strong visible‐light emission (color range from purple to blue) has been observed from doped silica xerogel. Because the dopant ions affect the band gap structure of the host materials, the emission wavelength and fluorescence intensity of the doped samples are varied. The emission spectra of the samples co‐doped with Cu2+ and Co2+ present a blue shift (a maximum at 440 nm).
