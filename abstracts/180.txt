A series of low‐density polyethylene (LDPE) blends with varying proportions of plasticized tapioca starch have been used for the study of their mechanical properties. A functionalized epoxy resin, namely, poly(ethylene‐co‐glycidyl methacrylate) has been used as the compatibilizer. The impact and tensile properties have been measured by standard ASTM methods. The mechanical properties are seen to improve significantly with the addition of the epoxy compatibilizer, approaching values close to those of virgin LDPE. The scanning electron micrographs of the compatibilized blends show ductile failure which evidently contribute to improved mechanical properties.
