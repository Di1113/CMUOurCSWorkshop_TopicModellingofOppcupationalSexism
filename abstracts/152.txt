Changes in gill Na+K+ATPase activity were examined following the transfer of brook charr (Salvelinus fontinalis) from fresh water (FW) to seawater (SW). Gonadal development was altered at the hatching stage using three doses of ionizing radiation (IR): 6.2, 7.8, and 11.4 Gray (Gy). A non‐irradiated control group was also included in the experimental set‐up. Following 15 and 19 months of growth in FW, assessment of gill activity in regard to gonadal status (sterile vs. mature) and level of IR exposure was realized by conducting two estuarine challenge tests. A first introduction was performed during June (period of highest osmoregulatory capacities for this species) (summer experiment). A second introduction was conducted during October (period of diminished osmoregulatory capacities) (fall experiment). Gill Na+K+ATPase activity and water content were measured at different times and two FW control samplings were added in October and January. In the summer experiment (June–December), normal gonadal development of female brook charr was related to reduced gill Na+K+ATPase activity during the spawning period as compared to sterile fish (4.0 ± 1.5 and 7.2 ± 1.9 μmole Pi · mg protein–1 · hr–1) (P < 0.0002). Similar results were not observed in FW conditions, implying that a lack of gonadal growth does not initiate a significant advantage when the osmoregulatory system including the gills are not highly in demand, i.e. in a FW environment. Ionizing radiation exposure of ≤ 11.4 Gy at the hatching stage had no significant negative or positive effect on Na+K+ATPase activity either in FW or SW conditions. J. Exp.
