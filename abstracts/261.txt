The ac magnetoresistance of thin films at frequencies up to 10 kHz was successfully measured. Patterned electrodes with mechanical flexibility were pressed onto the film surface by using a rubber pad. Induction noises were reduced considerably in comparison to the conventional four‐electrode method. A seven‐electrode system was developed to prevent high‐frequency induction noise, typically induced by leakage flux from the sample edges. It was found that the seven‐electrode system enables magnetoresistance measurements with little induction noise at frequencies up to 10 kHz. © 2000 Scripta Technica, Electr Eng Jpn, 132(2): 1–5, 2000
