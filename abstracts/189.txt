The mutual coupling between cylindrical–rectangular microstrip patch antennas with a cylindrical superstrate is analyzed with the use of the conformal FDTD (CFDTD) method. The method is also applied to antennas mounted on flat structures for comparison. The effects of superstrate permittivity and thickness on the mutual coupling between cylindrical–rectangular microstrip patch antennas are presented. Curvature effects on the mutual coupling are also shown. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Microwave Opt Technol Lett 33: 64–68, 2002
