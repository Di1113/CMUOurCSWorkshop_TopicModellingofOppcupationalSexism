The O−H⋅⋅⋅O interaction formed by the anions HCO3− and CO32− has been investigated on the basis of data retrieved from the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD) and by means of ab initio computations. It has been shown that the O⋅⋅⋅O separations associated with HCO3−⋅⋅⋅CO32− interactions are shorter than those found in crystals containing hydrogen carbonate monoanions such as HCO3−⋅⋅⋅HCO3−. Ab initio MP 2/6‐311G++(2d,2p) computations on the crystal Na3(HCO3)(CO3)⋅2 H2O have shown that the interaction between the monoanion donor and the dianion acceptor, for example HCO3−⋅⋅⋅CO32−, is more repulsive than that between singly charged ions, for example HCO3−⋅⋅⋅HCO3−, but is largely overcompensated for by anion–cation electrostatic attractions. The shortening of the −O−H⋅⋅⋅O2− interaction relative to the −O−H⋅⋅⋅O− interaction has been explained as a consequence of the increased charge compression, that is of the stronger cation–anion interactions established by the CO32− dianions with respect to those established by monoanions, and does not reflect an increase in the strength of the −O−H⋅⋅⋅On− interaction. To expand the structural sample in the crystal packing analysis, the structure of the novel mixed salt K2Na(HCO3)(CO3)⋅2 H2O has been determined by single‐crystal X‐ray diffraction and compared with the structure of the salt Na3(HCO3)(CO3)⋅2 H2O used in the computations.
