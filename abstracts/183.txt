The principal aim of this study is to explore the effect of chitosan on the physical properties of cotton fabrics in rapid curing crease‐resistant processing. It was determined that compared with the traditional three‐stage processing, the addition of chitosan is beneficial to the absorbency of processed fabrics, dry‐wet wrinkle recovery angle, and tensile strength retention. In addition, the dry‐wet wrinkle recovery angle of processed fabrics increases with the increase of curing temperature and curing treatment time, but absorbency and tensile strength retention both decrease. Also, the dry‐wet wrinkle recovery angle and tensile strength retention of processed fabrics increase with higher chitosan concentrations, but the fabric's absorbency is reduced. In general, use of 0.5%≈︁0.75% chitosan with DMEU curing treatment conditions of 8%, 200°C for 30 s will provide optimum physical property balance for processed fabrics. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
