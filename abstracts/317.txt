The synthesis and the solution behavior of the linear peptides containing a β‐homo (β‐H) leucine residue—Boc–Leu–β‐HLeu–Leu–OMe, Boc–β‐HLeu–Leu–β‐HLeu–Leu–OMe, and Boc–Leu–β‐HLeu–Leu–β‐HLeu–Leu–OMe—as well as the solid structure of the tripeptide, are reported. The conformational behavior of the peptides was investigated in solution by two‐dimensional nmr. Our data support the existence in solution with different families of conformers in rapid interchange. The crystals of the tripeptide are orthorhombic, space group P21212, with a = 15.829(1) Å, b = 29.659(1) Å, c = 6.563(1) Å, and Z = 4. The structure has been solved by direct methods and refined to final R1 and wR2 indexes of 0.0530 and 0.1436 for 2420 reflections with I > 2σ(I). In the solid state, the tripeptide does not present intramolecular H bonds, and the peptide backbone of the two leucine residues adopts a quasi‐extended conformation. For the β‐HLeu residue, the backbone conformation is specified by the torsion angles ϕ2 = −120.9(4)°, μ2 = 56.7(4)°, ψ3 = −133.2(4)°. The side chains of the three residues assume the same conformation (g−, g−, trans), and all peptide bonds, except the urethane group at the N‐terminus, are in the trans conformation. Preliminary conformational energy calculations carried out on the Ac–NH–β‐HAla–NHMe underline that the conformations with μ angle equal to 180° and 60° assume lower energy with respect to the others. In addition, we found a larger conformational freedom for the ψ angle with respect to the ϕ angle. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Biopoly 53: 140–149, 2000
