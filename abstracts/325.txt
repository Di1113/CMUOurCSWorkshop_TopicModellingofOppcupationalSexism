Magneto‐optical Kerr effect has been employed for the investigation of the magnetization reversal process in Co‐rich amorphous wires. The Kerr effect experiments have been performed in a new configuration with circular magnetic field produced by an electric current flowing through the studied wire. Changes of the Kerr effect hysteresis loops after annealing have been found to be related with the magnetic domain structure modification. This modification is attributed to the change of sign of magnetostriction constant.
