Epoxy‐based film adhesive formulations were developed with 10 wt % solid carboxyl functional rubber. Due to the high rubber content and resulting viscosity restrictions, the rubber could not be prereacted with the epoxy before hot‐melt filming. Therefore, an esterification catalyst was used to perform this reaction in situ before the epoxy curing reactions. The performance of this adhesive system is compared to that of one without the esterification catalyst. A significant difference in the flow characteristics was observed with incorporation of the esterification catalyst, but only small variations in mechanical performance were found. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
