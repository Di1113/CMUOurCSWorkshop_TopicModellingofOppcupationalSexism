A new methodology to incorporate the effect of failure mechanisms into interconnection circuit performance simulation is developed. The effect of corrosion on the performance of high speed multi‐chip module interconnects has been investigated. The method presented in this paper may be applied to the study of other failure mechanisms through the simulation of the gradual degradation of signal integrity.
