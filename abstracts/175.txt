A poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT)/linear low‐density polyethylene (LLDPE) alloy was prepared with a reactive extrusion method. For improved compatibility of the blending system, LLDPE grafted with acrylic acid (LLDPE‐g‐AA) by radiation was adopted in place of plain LLDPE. The toughness and extensibility of the PBT/LLDPE‐g‐AA blends, as characterized by the impact strengths and elongations at break, were much improved in comparison with the toughness and extensibility of the PBT/LLDPE blends at the same compositions. However, there was not much difference in their tensile (or flexural) strengths and moduli. Scanning electron microscopy photographs showed that the domains of PBT/LLDPE‐g‐AA were much smaller and their dispersions were more homogeneous than the domains and dispersions of the PBT/LLDPE blends. Compared with the related values of the PBT/LLDPE blends, the contents and melting temperatures of the usual spherulites of PBT in PBT/LLDPE‐g‐AA decreased. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
