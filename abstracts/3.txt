Positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) was used to investigate the phase transitions, mainly the glass transition, of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and nylon‐6 during the thermal treatment of these polymers. The longest‐lived component lifetime and intensity, indicative of ortho‐positronium pick‐off, exhibit thermal dependencies that can be attributed to the free‐volume changes associated with structural transitions. Glass transition temperatures and the volume of intermolecular‐space holes among polymer chains were obtained from the lifetime, τ3 and intensity of formation, I3, of the long‐lived component of ortho‐positronium. For PET, the free‐volume fraction and thermal expansion coefficients related to the free‐volume fraction were also obtained. Double glass transition behavior was noted in the analyzed polymers, which was consistent with their semicrystalline nature as revealed by differential scanning calorimetry. Increases in the slope of the lifetime‐temperature plots for nylon‐6 and PET were interpreted to suggest that glass transitions are followed by an increased free‐volume cavity expansion as temperature is increased. The intensity response for PET was consistent with the association of glass transition with the reduction of crystalline consraint on segmental mobility in the amorphous phase. In contrast, the intensity behavior during the thermal treatment of nylon‐6 seems to be governed more by the electronic effects occurring when the polymer chains acquire mobility than by free‐volume changes. Since the sensitivity of PALS is in the order of nanometers, it is expected to give an alternative novel technique to estimate phase transitions and relaxations in polymers from the point of view of the free volume. © 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
