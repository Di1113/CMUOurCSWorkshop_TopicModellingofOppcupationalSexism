The aqueous (WE) and ethanol (EE) leaf extracts of Pentaclethra macrophylla were tested for antidiarrhoeal activity using experimental animal models. The i.p. LD50 values were established to be 770 mg/kg and 280 mg/kg for the aqueous (WE) and ethanol (EE) extracts, respectively. Antidiarrhoeal potential of the extracts was evidenced by a significant reduction in faecal output and protection from castor oil‐induced diarrhoea in rats treated with the extracts. In addition the extracts significantly (p < 0.05) decreased propulsive movement of gastrointestinal contents in mice. On isolated tissue preparations, the extracts significantly reduced in a non‐specific manner contractions evoked by acetylcholine, nicotine and histamine. The extracts inhibited the growth of common pathogenic microorganisms. The antispasmodic as well as the antimicrobial effects of the extracts may explain the rationale for the use of the plant in traditional medicine as a popular antidiarrhoeal recipe.
