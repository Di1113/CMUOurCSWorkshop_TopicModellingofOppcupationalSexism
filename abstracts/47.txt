In this first part of a two‐part article, the author presents on some aspects of process supervision in the course of therapy of one patient. Vignettes from two psychotherapy sessions presented for supervision will be analysed to highlight some of the technical and metapsychological knowledge required to properly conduct therapy using Dr. Davanloo's technique of Intensive Short‐Term Dynamic Psychotherapy. The set of technical interventions and metapsychological knowledge required to correct some of the therapist's problems as outlined in the supervisory process will be highlighted.
