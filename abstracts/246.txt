The failure rate of replantations following a crush‐avulsion type injury is high. This study has been designed to reproduce an effective standardized crush‐avulsion injury model to the femoral artery of the rat and evaluate the antithrombotic efficacy of systemic intravenous administration of recombinant human tissue‐type plasminogen activator (rt‐PA). The crush‐avulsion injury was reproduced by using a bulldog clamp and two hemostats and followed by microvascular repair. The animals were divided into three groups of 20 rats each and received either normal saline, heparin 100 U/kg body weight, or rt‐PA 3.5 mg/kg body weight intravenously. Patency tests were performed 20 min and 48 h after blood flow reestablishment. Results showed that this experimental crush‐avulsion injury model ensures low patency in the control group, whereas systemic rt‐PA administration improves the patency rate statistically significantly compared to control and heparin groups at both 20 min and 48 h postrevascularization. © 2000 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.
