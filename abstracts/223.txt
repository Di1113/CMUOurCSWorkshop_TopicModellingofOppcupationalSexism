CAD‐oriented closed‐form expressions are presented for calculating the quasistatic parameters of the asymmetrical coplanar waveguides (ACPWs) with finite ground planes. The effect of the ground‐plane width on the quasistatic parameters has been investigated by using the formulas derived by the conformal mapping techniques. Comparisons have also been made between this paper's results and the results available in the literature for the conventional coplanar waveguide (CPW) and ACPW. The results of this paper are in very good agreement with the results derived by conformal mapping and by the spectral‐domain method. It has been shown that the present expressions can also be used for calculating the quasistatic parameters of both symmetric and asymmetric CPWs with finite and infinite ground planes. ©1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
