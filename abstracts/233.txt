Canasite glass–ceramics were modified by either increasing the concentration of calcium in the glass, or by the addition of P2O5. Samples of these novel materials were placed in simulated body fluid (SBF), along with a control material (commercial canasite), for periods ranging from 12 h to 28 days. After immersion, surface analysis was performed using thin film X‐ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared reflection spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy equipped with energy dispersive X‐ray detectors. The concentrations of sodium, potassium, calcium, silicon, and phosphorus in the SBF solution were measured using inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy. No apatite was detected on the surface of commercial canasite, even after 28 days of immersion in SBF. A crystalline apatite layer was formed on the surface of a P2O5‐containing canasite after 5 days, and after 3 days for calcium‐enriched canasite. Ion release data suggested that the mechanism for apatite deposition was different for P2O5 and non‐P2O5‐containing glass–ceramics. © 2001 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed Mater Res 59: 473–480, 2002
