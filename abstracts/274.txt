Syndiotactic‐rich ultrahigh molecular weight poly(vinyl alcohol) (UHMW S‐PVA) gels having syndiotactic diad (S‐diad) contents of 61.5, 58.2, and 55.7% and similar molecular weights were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)/water solution. The gelation temperature of UHMW S‐PVA/DMSO/water solution decreases with an increase in syndiotacticity. A great difference in the gel melting temperature (Tgm) was not found between the gels having an S‐diad content over 58.2%. However, a significant decrease of Tgm was revealed in the gel having an S‐diad content of 55.7%. The enthalpy of junction fusion and the number of segments participating in the junction of the UHMW S‐PVA gel increases with syndiotacticity, and they are remarkably higher than the values of atactic PVAs reported in previous papers. The higher the syndiotacticity of the UHMW S‐PVA gel, the higher is the dynamic storage modulus. The elasticity of the PVA gel with an S‐diad content over 58.2% was recovered under cooling after heating, whereas almost no recovery was found in the gel having an S‐diad content of 55.7%. The PVA gel having an S‐diad content over 58.2% is opaque and exhibits a phase separated appearance in optical morphology, while the PVA gel with an S‐diad content of 55.7% is almost transparent and phase separation does not occur. A highly microporous and close structure was observed for the surface of the UHMW S‐PVA gels.
