Filled covulcanizates of elastomer blend comprising natural rubber (NR) and ethylene‐propylene‐diene rubber (EPDM) of commercial importance were successfully prepared by using a multifunctional rubber additive; namely, bis(diisopropyl)thiophosphoryl disulfide (DIPDIS). A Two‐stage vulcanization technique further improved the physicochemical properties of the blend vulcanizates by restricting, through the formation of polar rubber bound intermediates, the migration of curative and filler from lower to highly unsaturated rubber. Scanning electron microscopy studies indicate homogeneity and coherency in the morphology of the two‐stage vulcanizates. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
