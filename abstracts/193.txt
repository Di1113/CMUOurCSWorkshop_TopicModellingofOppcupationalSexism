Cyclosporine is a potent immunosuppressant used in the treatment of ulcerative colitis and keratoconjunctivitis sicca. Neither the etiologies of these diseases nor the mechanism by which cyclosporine exerts its therapeutic effect is well understood. Since both diseases are linked by a common decrease in mucin‐filled goblet cells, this study tests a hypothesis that cyclosporine acts directly on goblet cells to promote their differentiation and production of secretory mucins. The HT29‐18N2 human colon adenocarcinoma cell line, which is capable of forming monolayers of well‐differentiated goblet cells, was used as a model system. Cyclosporine induced a dose‐dependent increase in intracellular mucin stores. A 2‐week exposure to 1 μM cyclosporine resulted in an average increase in mucin volume of 94%. This increase resulted from both a higher percentage of cells with mucin stores and an increased volume of mucin per cell. PSC‐833, a nonimmunosuppressive analog of cyclosporine, also increased mucin production. The intracellular accumulation of mucin was not a result of reduced secretion, since the time required for the release of pulse‐radiolabeled glycoproteins was similar for both control and cyclosporine‐treated monolayers. The effect of cyclosporine was not mediated by the drug's previously documented abilities to decrease cellular proliferation rates, inhibit calmodulin, antagonize prolactin receptor binding, or modulate prostaglandin production.
