An alternative measurement method for the giant magneto‐impedance effect is presented in this study. The method measures pulse width instead of induced voltage between the ends of an amorphous wire as a function of external dc magnetic field. Amorphous magnetic wire with (Co0.94Fe0.06)72.5Si12.5B15 composition was used in this study. In the position sensing measurements, a small permanent magnet is brought near the wire and the pulse width response is measured as a function of distance between the permanent magnet and the amorphous as‐received wire. The advantages of the alternative measurement method for the giant magneto‐impedance effect for position detection are also discussed.
