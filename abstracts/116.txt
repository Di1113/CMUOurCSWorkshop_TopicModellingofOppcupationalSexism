Mercury‐electroplated iridium microband arrays intended for heavy metal determination purposes were successfully fabricated by means of microelectronic processing techniques. Iridium microbands of 5 μm width each and lengths of 50 μm, 100 μm and 5 mm were investigated and their diffusion behavior and analytical performance compared with those of 5 μm microdisk arrays. The limiting current responses of disk arrays and 5 mm length microband arrays were found to be in good agreement with the radial and hemicylindrical flux expressions, respectively. In contrast, microband arrays having an aspect ratio (length/width) below 50 exhibit diffusion profiles that are characterized by a mixture of both radial and hemicylindrical diffusion components. Such a behavior is thought to be a consequence of edge effects at the extremity of the bands. To perform square‐wave anodic stripping voltammetry (SWASV) analysis, the iridium microelectrode arrays were successfully Hg‐electroplated and a complete surface coverage was obtained even on microbands having an aspect ratio as high as 1000. The electroanalytical performance of the various Hg‐electroplated iridium microelectrode array geometries was evaluated by measuring Cd and Pb ion concentrations in synthetic solutions by means of SWASV over a concentration range as wide as 0.1 to 50 μg L−1. Their detection efficiency (as expressed by the redissolution current normalized to the microelectrodes surface) is shown to be significantly lower than that of microdisk arrays having the same critical dimension (5 μm). Moreover, not only the detection efficiency but also the detection limits were found to decrease as the length of the microbands increases.
