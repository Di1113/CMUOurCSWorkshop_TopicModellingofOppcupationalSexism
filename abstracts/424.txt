Efficacy of soil fumigation with methyl bromide and methyl iodide against Botrytis cinerea, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, Fusarium oxysporum, Gliocladium virens, Phytophthora citricola, Phytophthora citrophthora, Pythium ultimum, Rhizoctonia solani and Verticillium dahliae was determined in laboratory experiments in closed fumigation chambers. Pythium ultimum was the most sensitive fungal species with EC50 values for methyl bromide and methyl iodide of 15.5 and 8.6 µM, respectively. R solani was the least sensitive with EC50 values of 253.4 and 161.4 µM for methyl bromide and methyl iodide, respectively. Relative potency ([methyl bromide]/[methyl iodide]) values ranged from 5.2 for P citricola to 1.5 for F oxysporum. Methyl iodide was 2.7 more efficacious than methyl bromide averaged over all fungal species. Methyl bromide/chloropicrin and methyl iodide/chloropicrin applied jointly were 2.2 and 2.8 times more efficacious, respectively, against F oxysporum than when the compounds were applied singly. Combining methyl bromide and methyl iodide with chloropicrin resulted in a significant synergistic increase in activity against F oxysporum.
