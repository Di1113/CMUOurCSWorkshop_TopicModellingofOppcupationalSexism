Cellasene, a product containing Ginkgo biloba, sweet clover, sea‐weed, grape seed oil, lecithins and evening primrose oil, has been marketed all over the world as a miracle cure for cellulite. As the efficacy of the product was in doubt, a parallel placebo‐controlled clinical study was undertaken in a group of women to see whether the product had any effect on cellulite, or on the body weight, fat content, circumference of thighs, hips, etc. No significant changes were found in these parameters compared with the starting values, nor compared with the placebo control after a 2 month course of Cellasene, except for an increase in the cellulite, assessed by the author, compared with that initially. Seven of 11 women taking Cellasene gained weight, as did eight in the placebo control group, taking Colonease, where significance was achieved. The weight gain in both groups was apparent after the first 2 weeks, and all women had to reduce their food consumption. Only three of the women in the Cellasene group thought that their cellulite had slightly improved against two women in the control group. Copyright © 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
