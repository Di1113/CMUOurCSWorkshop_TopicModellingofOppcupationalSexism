What connects the author Marcel Proust, the Chemistry Nobel Laureate Henri Moissan, and the fraudulent engineer Henri Fran√ßois Lemoine? Moissan was obsessed with the idea of preparing artificial diamonds, Lemoine alleged that he had improved the Moissan technique, which only produced diamond dust, and Proust first invested a part of his wealth in the alleged diamond synthesis and then exploited the scandal in a literary work.
