This paper presents results of investigations on the magnetoelastic Villari effect in nanocrystalline Fe73.5Nb3Cu1Si13.5B9 alloy. The investigations were carried out using a ribbon ring sample. A special cylindrical backing was used in order to obtain uniform compressive stresses —σ in the sample. The experiment was performed for compressive stresses up to 10 MPa. The changes of flux density B(—σ) were investigated as a function of compressive stresses —σ for different values of the magnetizing field. Significant changes of the flux density B and the Villari point were detected. The experimental results are discussed.
