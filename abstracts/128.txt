In this study, we investigated the role of diisocyanate on the properties of polyurethane acrylate (PUA) prepolymers based on polypropylene oxide (M̄n = 2000 g · mol−1). The diisocyanates studied were isophorone diisocyanate, 4‐4′dicyclohexylmethane diisocyanate, and toluene diisocyanate (pure 2,4‐TDI, pure 2,6‐TDI, and a TDI mixture, TDItech). The molecular structure of the diisocyanate had a major role on the course of the polycondensation and, more precisely, on the sequence length distribution of the final prepolymer. Moreover, the structural organization of the prepolymer also strongly depended on the nature of the diisocyanate. Two types of behaviors were particularly emphasized. On the one hand, the PUA synthesized from 2,4‐TDI displayed an enhanced intermixing between soft polyether segments and hard urethane groups, as revealed by the analysis of hydrogen bonding in Fourier transform infrared. Consecutively, the glass transition shifted to higher temperatures for these polymers. On the other hand, strong hard–hard inter‐urethane associations were observed in 2,6‐TDI‐based prepolymers; these led to microphase segregation between polyether chains and urethane groups, as revealed by optical microscopy. This inhomogeneous structure was thought to be responsible for the unusual rheological behavior of these PUA prepolymers. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. J Polym Sci B: Polym Phys 38: 2750–2768, 2000
