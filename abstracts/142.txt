The aqueous consolidation of jute slivers and its comparison with the control in the LDPE matrix were studied in this article. The increase in strength of the consolidated jute sliver–LDPE composite was noticed. Jute slivers were immersed in water, squeezed, air dried, and finally consolidated at 160°C for 5 min. These treated jute slivers with or without CSM (chopped strand mat) and LDPE films were compression molded to different boards and compared among themselves. The studies undertaken for characterization and analysis of the system were (a) flexural behavior, (b) tensile behavior, (c) impact behavior, (d) DMA study, and (e) SEM study. Among mechanical properties maximum gain was found in the impact strength. In the SEM study splitting of fibers were observed after consolidation. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
