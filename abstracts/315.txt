Helicobacter pylori infection in stomach has been extensively assessed by the 13C‐urea breath test (UBT) with infra‐red or mass spectrometer. However, analyses of commercially available 13C‐urea for UBT showed about 10 atom% of 18O abundance. It is therefore very important to investigate the 18O‐isotope effect on UBT. Using a mass spectrometer, breath samples of UBT were analyzed to investigate the change of mass spectra by the isotopic exchange reaction between 18O of carbon dioxide and 16O of water. As the result, the 18O content of 13C, 18O‐carbon dioxide exhaled in UBT reached its natural abundance level immediately after the administration of 13C, 18O‐urea. It was concluded that the 18O content of 13C, 18O‐urea has no effect on UBT using either infra‐red or mass spectroscopy. Copyright © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
