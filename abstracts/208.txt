In this paper, the Curie temperature of ferroelectric films is studied using spin‐1/2 transverse Ising model with long‐range interaction within the framework of the effective‐field theory. The dependence of the Curie temperature on the thickness of the film, the surface interaction and the transverse field were investigated. It is assumed that the long‐range interaction decays with the distance between the pseudo‐spins as a power law. The dependence of the Curie temperature and the critical transverse field on the long‐range exponent are obtained.
