The results of (1) two experiments by Guth et al. and (2) an experiment by Nakano et al. on additivity‐law failure were estimated using a simple formula for predicting the brightness/luminance ratio effect on the variable chromatic color method. The special feature of these experiments was to test additivity‐law failures on mixture colors whose two component colors were mixed at varied mixing ratios. Agreement on additivity‐law failures between the experimental results and the corresponding predictions was found to be remarkably good for trend and fairly good for magnitude for all the experiments analyzed. © 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
