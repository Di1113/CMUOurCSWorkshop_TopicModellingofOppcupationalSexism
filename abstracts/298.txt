The effects of uneven application of an azadirachtin‐enriched neem extract to wheat grain on the reproduction and feeding behaviour in Rhyzopertha dominica (F) were investigated. The evenness of distribution amongst individual wheat grains during grain treatment was not important in ensuring its effectiveness as an anti‐feedant or as an insect growth regulator, provided that, overall, the grain was treated with an effective level of azadirachtin. The effect of azadirachtin on reproduction was not improved when the diluent application rates were increased from 0.5 ml kg−1 to 5 ml kg−1. Treating 10% of the grain was shown to provide the same level of protection as treating 100% of the grain. The anti‐feedant effect of azadirachtin on the beetle was also unaffected by unevenness of treatment, provided that 50% of the grain was treated. The fact that azadirachtin remains effective even when application to grain is uneven may be advantageous in field situations where uniform distribution of insecticides is difficult to achieve.
