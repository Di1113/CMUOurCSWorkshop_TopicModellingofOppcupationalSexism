A novel polyimide (PI) with mesogenic units was synthesized by the reaction between the pendent hydroxyl group of PI and the epoxy group of a liquid crystalline (LC) compound in the presence of N,N‐dimethylaniline at 120–130 °C. As a result, a novel in‐situ self‐reinforced PI film materials was obtained. The macromolecular reaction between the hydroxyl group and epoxy group was investigated by a model reaction. The properties of PI were studied by WAXD, DSC and polarized optical microscopy, and the results indicate that the polyimides with mesogenic units exhibit a smectic phase, the mesogenic units level influencing the side‐chain crystallinity, and also the thermal and mechanical properties of the polymers; the enhanced PI films possess good solubility, higher thermal stability, higher tensile strength and modulus.
