The effect of human immunodeficiency virus‐1 protease inhibitors on the frequency of human herpesvirus 8 DNA detection from peripheral blood of human immunodeficiency virus‐positive persons was evaluated. Thirty‐three human immunodeficiency virus‐seropositive male patients were studied longitudinally. DNA from open reading frame 26 of the human herpesvirus 8 genome was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction from the CD45+ fraction of peripheral blood before and after the introduction of protease inhibitor therapy. Human herpesvirus 8 IgG status, CD4+ cell counts, and human immunodeficiency virus‐1 plasma viral load were also assessed before and after therapy. When both reverse transcriptase inhibitor and protease inhibitor treatment were introduced at the same time, there was an increase in CD4+ T cell counts (P=0.0041), a decrease in human immunodeficiency virus plasma load (P=0.0584), and a decrease in the detection rate of human herpesvirus 8 DNA (P=0.0077). Introducing protease inhibitor to patients already receiving reverse transcriptase inhibitor treatment was associated with an increase in CD4+ T cell counts (P=0.0003), a decrease in human immunodeficiency virus plasma viral load (P=0.0911), and a decrease in the human herpesvirus 8 detection rate (P=0.0412). No significant changes in the titters of anti‐human herpesvirus 8 IgG were observed. Treatment with human immunodeficiency virus‐1 protease inhibitors is therefore associated with the clearance of human herpesvirus 8 DNA from peripheral blood of human immunodeficiency virus‐infected patients. The concomitant decrease in the human immunodeficiency virus plasma load and increase in the peripheral CD4+ cell count suggest that an amelioration in the immune defect following reduction in the burden of human immunodeficiency virus‐1 infection is responsible for the clearance of human herpesvirus 8 by protease inhibitors.
