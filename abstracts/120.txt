In this study, the effect of l‐dopa and bromocriptine on morphine withdrawal syndrome was compared. Both l‐dopa (125, 250 mg/kg, i.p.) and low doses of bromocriptine (0·04, 0·08 mg/kg, i.p.) potentiated naloxone‐induced morphine withdrawal symptoms such as jumping, climbing and rearing in mice. Higher doses of bromocriptine (0·16, 0·32 mg/kg, i.p.) attenuated these naloxone‐induced symptoms. SKF 83566, D1 dopamine antagonist (0·4, 0·8 mg/kg, i.p.) and sulpiride, D2 dopamine antagonist (5, 10 mg/kg, i.p.) when used alone, also produced inhibitory effects on naloxone‐induced morphine withdrawal symptoms. Pretreatment with sulpiride (5, 10 mg/kg, i.p.) and SKF 83566 (0·4, 0·8 mg/kg, i.p.) attenuated the potentiating effects of l‐dopa on withdrawal symptoms significantly. Pretreatment with sulpiride also decreased the potentiating effect of bromocriptine and reinforced the inhibitory action of it, but SKF 83566 pretreatment just reinforced the effect of higher doses of bromocriptine. Concurrent pretreatment of animals with sulpiride (10 mg/kg, i.p.) and SKF 83566 (0.8 mg/kg, i.p.) markedly decreased the potentiating effects of l‐dopa and bromocriptine and reinforced the inhibitory action of bromocriptine on the naloxone‐induced morphine withdrawal syndrome. Prazosin, α1 antagonist (1, 2 mg/kg, i.p.) decreased the naloxone‐induced morphine withdrawal syndrome significantly. Pretreatment with yohimbine, α2‐antagonist (5 mg/kg, i.p.) reversed the inhibitory effects of bromocriptine (0·16, 0·32 mg/kg, i.p.) on naloxone‐induced morphine withdrawal syndrome significantly. In conclusion, our results show that bromocriptine at lower doses (0·04, 0·08 mg/kg, i.p.) acts similar to l‐dopa, but at higher doses (0·16, 0·32 mg/kg, i.p.) shows different effects on naloxone‐induced morphine withdrawal syndrome which may be due to the interaction of bromocriptine with α‐adrenoceptors.
