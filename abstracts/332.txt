Based on a vectorial three‐dimensional electromagnetic modeling approach combining the surface integral equation method and the mode‐matching method, the coupling phenomena of the wavelength‐flattened coupler (WFC) with the polarization effect being included are investigated. It is found that the polarization effect of the WFC is strongly dependent on the geometrical structure parameters. There are optimum combinations of the structure parameters for designing a WFC without a polarization effect. ©1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Microwave Opt Technol Lett 23: 12–16, 1999.
