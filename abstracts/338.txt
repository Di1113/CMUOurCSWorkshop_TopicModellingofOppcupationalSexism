We studied improvement of the electrode/organic interface in organic electroluminescent diodes which consist of 8‐hydroxyquinoline aluminum (Alq3) and diamine derivative (TPD). An aluminum oxide (Al2O3) monolayer was inserted between TPD and the indium tin oxide (ITO) anode. An improvement of emission is observed in a diode with an Al2O3 layer between 0.5 and 1 nm thick inserted in the surface of the anode/organic layer. The mechanism of increase in emission efficiency is discussed. © 2000 Scripta Technica Electr Eng Jpn 132(3): 14–18, 2000
