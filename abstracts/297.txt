The properties of In1−xGaxAsyP1−y–In1−xGaxAsyP1−y were studied as a function of substrate orientation. The Luttinger–Kohn formalism was used for holes, and a simple effective mass equation was used for conduction electrons. A novel method to calculate the TE optical modal gain was used. It was found that the modal gain is strongly dependent on the substrate orientation. At carrier concentrations less than 3.5×10cm−3, it has its largest value for the (111) growth direction. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Microwave Opt Technol Lett 27: 407–410, 2000.
