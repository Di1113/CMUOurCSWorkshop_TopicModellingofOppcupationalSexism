The diffusive properties of acetone, dichloromethane, and toluene in natural, nitrile, and bromobutyl rubber membranes at temperatures between 273 and 313 K and uniaxial elongations between 0 and 40% were investigated. As the temperature and elongation increase, the steady state flux increases, and the breakthrough time decreases. An increase in temperature leads to an increase in permeability, and small extensions do not cause significant changes in the diffusive properties. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
