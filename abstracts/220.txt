A mathematical description of the Portevin‐Le Ch�telier (PLC) effect is presented in the form of delay differential equations. Inclusion of a delay time in the dislocation evolution equations has been found to be helpful in explaining a number of experimentally observed results. The results of the simulation reproduce some basic features of the PLC effect such as the strain‐rate window within which the effect occurs, increase in stress drop and period of stress oscillation with change in strain rate, and the occurrence of chaotic stress oscillations under certain conditions.
