Marsypianthes chamaedrys is a common herb that occurs in the North and Northeast regions of Brazil. Phytochemical studies showed this plant to be rich in triterpenoids. The hexane extract of M. chamaedrys yielded, after chromatographic separations, two mixtures: the first containing monohydroxylated­compounds (α‐amyrin, β‐amyrin, lupeol and germanicol) and the second, dihydroxylated compounds (chamaedrydiol, castanopsol, 2α‐hydroxylupeol and epigermanidiol). Molluscicidal tests were performed for the crude hexane extract and for mixtures I and II. Mixture II showed high activity. Copyright © 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
