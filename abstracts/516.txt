The curing characteristics of a brominated epoxy resin/dicyandiamide (DICY) system in the presence of different DICY contents and metal oxides are studied using isothermal differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). From the exotherms obtained, it is found that the reaction heats increase with increasing DICY content and curing temperature because of greater amounts of DICY reacted. The amine–epoxy‐related reaction dominates the major curing behavior and the Tg especially at the high curing temperature, while the etherification is more significant at low temperature and conversion and plays an important role in determining the rate of liquid‐to‐solid transition during the cure. The addition of metal oxides, Fe2O3, and ZnO, results in changes in the initial transition rate, Tg, activation energy, reaction heat, reaction rate, and reaction order. Three fillers respond differently because of a difference in the surface‐activated reaction. Regardless of the complex curing mechanisms involved in the specimens, a simple kinetic expression can describe the curing extent at 180°C with good accuracy. © 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
