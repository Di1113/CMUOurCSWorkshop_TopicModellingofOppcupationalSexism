This article examines the effect of regional variations and migration on the income gap within young dual university‐graduate households in Sweden. Using a unique database for the entire Swedish population which makes longitudinal comparison possible, the geographical distribution of, and the intra‐household income gap in, young dual‐graduate households are analysed. Focus is placed on changes in the internal income gap in the households, depending on residential region, migration or staying, and the region of in‐migration. The young dual‐graduate households in Sweden are more concentrated in large city areas and in educational centres, compared with other households in the same age groups. The results of the analyses show that regional differences in income level are manifested in absolute differences in intra‐household income equality. Regions considered to be more gender‐equal do not have a greater degree of income equality. As for migration, the migratory action in itself increases the intra‐household income gap within the studied households. Copyright © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
