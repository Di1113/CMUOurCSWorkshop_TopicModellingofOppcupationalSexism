Although the colour of different meat products has been studied, particularly in the final product , these studies do not separate the influence of degree of mincing from other factors such as additives, spices, manufacturing process, etc. The effect of degree of mincing on colour (CIELAB colour space) in pork meat was studied. Three mincing processes were studied, two using a grinder with 10 and 20 mm diameter holes in the plate, and a third in which a cutter was used to obtain a finely minced product. As control, intact meat was used. Colour parameters [lightness (L*), redness (a*), yellowness (b*), chroma (C*), hue (H*), a*/b* ratio, and colour differences], pH, and water holding capacity were determined. Mincing, regardless of the type used, increased the values of L*, b*, and H*, but decreased the values of a* and a*/b* ratio. The L* values increased with mincing degree. The H* values and a*/b* ratio of plate minced meats (10 and 20 mm) differed from that which had been finely minced. The mincing process did not modify the saturation values of the batters. Only the fine mincing process modified (increased) the water holding capacity of the batters. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Col Res Appl, 25, 376–380, 2000
