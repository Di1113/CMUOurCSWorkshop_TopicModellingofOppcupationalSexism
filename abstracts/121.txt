A two‐dimensional analytical model for the current–voltage characteristics of a pseudomorphic AlGaAs/InGaAs modulation‐doped field‐effect transistor is developed using charge‐control analysis for its microwave circuit applications. The two‐dimensional potential, field, electron concentration, and velocity profiles are expressed explicitly in the saturation region. The results so obtained are compared with the experimental data, and show excellent agreement, thereby proving the validity of the model. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
