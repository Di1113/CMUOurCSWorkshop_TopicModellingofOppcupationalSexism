This work is aimed at optimizing the percentage of reprocessed nylon 6 that can be added with virgin nylon 6 without undue sacrifice in properties. The effect of annealing on various properties such as tensile strength, impact strength, hardness, heat deflection temperature, abrasion resistance, and dimensional variation are studied. The annealed samples of 70/30 composition (virgin/reprocessed) have shown remarkable improvement in mechanical strength when compared to nonannealed samples. Thus a costly material like polyacetal, which is used to make critical roller components of printers, may be replaced by less costlier nylon 6 with recommended proportion of regrind without affecting the desired properties. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
