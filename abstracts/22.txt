Linear stability analysis of a thin vapor film in subcooled film boiling on a horizontal cylinder is reported. The effects of liquid inertia, vapor viscosity and compressibility, and heat transfer were taken into account. Theoretical predictions of the heat transfer coefficient at the neutral stability point were compared with experimental data at the minimum‐heat‐flux point that was obtained during rapid quenching of thin horizontal wires in water and ethanol. At high liquid subcooling, the experimental value was 60% of the theoretical prediction irrespective of the wire diameter and quenching liquid. This difference was considered to be due to the nonuniformity of the vapor film which was neglected in the theoretical analysis. © 1998 Scripta Technica. Heat Trans Jpn Res, 26(4): 219–235, 1997
