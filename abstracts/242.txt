The free radicals 3‐ethoxy‐2‐(ethoxycarbonyl)‐3‐oxopropyl (1.) and 3‐ethoxy‐2‐(ethoxycarbonyl)‐2‐methyl‐3‐oxopropyl (2.) were generated by photolysis of perester precursors in i) hexane solution, ii) in the presence of β‐cyclodextrin, and iii) in NaY zeolite. While free radicals in solution are reluctant to rearrange, they do so when encapsulated in β‐cyclodextrin or NaY zeolite. The coenzyme‐B12‐dependent enzymic rearrangement of methylmalonyl‐CoA to succinyl‐CoA could be mimicked by photochemical generation of an analogue of the putative intermediate radical in a molecular container.
