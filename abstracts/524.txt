Twenty‐four Large White × Landrace pigs were individually fed, from 50 to 90 kg live weight, either a control (CONT) diet containing palm oil or one of three diets based on full‐fat rapeseed (FFR; 250 g kg−1) (diets RD). The RD diets were supplemented with 0, 200 or 500 mg DL‐α‐tocopherol acetate (ATA) kg−1 diet (diets RD0, RD200 and RD500 respectively). Diets were formulated to be isonitrogenous and isocaloric. M semimembranosus (S memb) muscle subcellular fractions (microsomes and mitochondria) were analysed for fatty acid composition, α‐tocopherol (AT) content and oxidative stability. The fatty acid composition of the neutral lipids (NL) and phospholipids (PL) of the membrane fractions were only slightly influenced by dietary fatty acid composition. Greater influence of dietary fatty acids was observed on the NL than on the PL. The mitochondrial fraction contained a higher content of unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) than the microsomal fraction. The AT content of the subcellular fractions increased with increasing levels of dietary ATA. AT was between 1.7 and 2.5‐fold higher in mitochondrial fractions than in microsomal fractions. As the ATA content of RD diets increased, the oxidation of membrane lipids decreased. More oxidation occurred in the microsomal fraction compared to the mitochondrial fraction, which can be attributed mainly to a lower AT/UFA ratio in the microsomal fraction.
