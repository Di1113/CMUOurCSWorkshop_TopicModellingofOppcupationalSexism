A numerical study is performed on transport phenomena in a turbulent jet diffusion flame of hydrogen from a vertical circular nozzle. An anisotropic k–ϵ–t2–ϵt model and the eddy‐dissipation model are employed to simulate thermal fluid flow and combustion phenomena, respectively. The governing boundary‐layer equations are discretized by means of a control volume finite‐difference technique and are numerically solved. The model predicts the experimental data in the existing literature. It is found from the study that (i) the model employed here can be applied to combustion phenomenon, and (ii) the presence of flame enhances the anisotropy of turbulence and causes a substantial attenuation in the turbulent kinetic energy, that is, most turbulent kinetic energy in the flame in the downstream part is laden exclusively in the streamwise fluctuation.
