The effects of diphenyltin dichloride (DPhT), triphenyltin chloride (TPhT) and tetraphenyltin (TTPhT) on the thermotropic phase behaviour of phosphatidylcholine bilayers were studied. All the phenyltin compounds investigated affected phase transitions differently. TTPhT broadened the main phase transition but it left the transition temperatures and enthalpy unchanged. TPhT reduced the transition temperatures and the enthalpies while DPhT showed a dual effect on the pretransition and the main transition. At low concentrations DPhT reduced the temperatures of the transitions slightly and at higher concentrations it increased them.
