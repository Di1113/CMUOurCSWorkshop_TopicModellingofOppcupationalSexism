The influence of physical aging on the tensile fracture behavior of notched Polyphenylquinoxaline (PPQ‐E) samples has been studied. The dependence of fracture stress and strain on physical aging has been explained. The glass transition temperature (Tg) and the endothermic peak at the end of Tg transition with different physical aging were characterized using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and the results have also been explained. The morphology of fracture surface was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. J Appl Polym Sci 78: 1275–1279, 2000
