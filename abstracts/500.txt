The fracture behavior of ABS materials with a particle diameter of 110 nm and of 330 nm was studied using instrumented Charpy impact tests. The effects of rubber content and temperature on fracture behavior, deformation mode, stable crack extension, plastic zone size, J‐integral value, and crack opening displacement were investigated. In the case of a particle size of 110 nm, the material was found to break in a brittle manner, and the dominant crack mechanism was unstable crack propagation. Fracture toughness increases with increasing rubber content. In the case of a particle size of 330 nm, brittle‐to‐tough transition was observed. The J‐integral value first increases with rubber content, then levels off after the rubber content is greater than 16 wt %. The J‐integral value of a particle diameter of 330 nm was found to be much greater than that of 110 nm. The J‐integral value of both series first increased with increasing temperature until reaching the maximum value, after which it decreased with further increasing temperature. The conclusion is that a particle diameter of 330 nm is more efficient than that of 110 nm in toughening, but for both series the effectiveness of rubber modification decreases with increasing temperatures higher than 40°C because of intrinsic craze formation in the SAN matrix at temperatures near the glass transition of SAN. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
