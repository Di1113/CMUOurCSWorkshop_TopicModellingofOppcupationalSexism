A molecular thermodynamic model based on the theory of melting point depression, the Adam–Gibbs configurational entropy model, and the modified lattice‐fluid model was developed to interpret ionic conductivities of solid polymer electrolytes with various pressures. A new configurational entropy, S was introduced in this model. Quantitative descriptions according to the proposed model agreed with the experimental data for the given systems. Our results showed that a eutectic point moves toward higher melting temperatures, whereas a lower weight fraction of salt and the ionic conductivity significantly decrease with pressure. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
