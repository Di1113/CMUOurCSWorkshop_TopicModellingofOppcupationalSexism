An extract of Cestrum parqui aerial parts in methanol:water (1:1) showed inhibition of carrageenin‐induced oedema. The aggregation of human blood platelets induced by adenosine diphosphate and platelet activating factor was also inhibited (IC50s were 3 and 2 mg/mL, respectively). On the contrary, the extract did not inhibit arachidonic acid‐mediated platelet aggregation. Copyright © 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
