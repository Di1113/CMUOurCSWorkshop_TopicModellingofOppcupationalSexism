The purpose of this study was to describe the mortality and fertility rates before, during, and after the move and social reorganization of the Washington Regional Primate Research Center's pigtailed macaque (Macaca nemestrina) and baboon (Papio cynocephalus, Papio anubis, and hybrids) breeding colonies from the Primate Field Station (PFS) (Medical Lake, WA) to the Tulane Regional Primate Research Center (Covington, LA). Colony records on all 598 pigtailed macaques (Macaca nemestrina) and 157 baboons (P. c. anubis) shipped to the Tulane Primate Center from the PFS breeding colony were used for analysis of species, sex, age, origin, current status, and the number of animals born at Tulane and their status. To provide comparative statistics, colony records on all 1,002 macaques and 258 baboons alive on 1 January 1991 at the Field Station were retrieved in the same manner as the Tulane data. Overall survival rates of macaques in the months following the move (71.7%) were similar to those associated with the Arashiyama West colony move from Japan to Texas. In our colony, significantly lower survival following the move was seen only in older (10 years+) macaques, while survival in other age groups was slightly lower than in the comparison year of 1991 at the Primate Field Station. Captive‐bred macaques exhibited higher survival than wild‐caught animals. Infant survival at Tulane was not significantly different than in pre‐move years. Baboons fared well in the move, with no significant differences in mortality or reproduction when compared with the 1991 Medical Lake baboon colony. Am. J.
