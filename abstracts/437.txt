We have investigated why chemically preoxidized Ti (TixOy) shows strongly enhanced adhesion towards electrochemically deposited polypyrrole (Ppy) films as compared to Ti substrate with only native oxide overlayers. The XPS and SIMS results indicate that considerable amounts of TixOy are present 50–200 nm above the nominal Ppy interface. On the basis of XPS background analysis, supported by the results of SIMS, we suggest that the formation of a titanium–Ppy intermediate layer during the electrochemical synthesis leads to the enhanced adhesion observed.
