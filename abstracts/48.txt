Absorption band parameters of the fundamental O–H stretching vibration of impurity hydroxyl groups in GeO2 glass samples before and after application of a hydrostatic pressure at 5.2 GPa are investigated. Quantum‐chemical calculations of the various structures of OH groups and H2O molecules in the germania glass are performed and analysed.
