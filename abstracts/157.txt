The main objective of this study was focused on sequential fractionation of spinach biomass, partial characterization of cadmium‐binding compounds and determination of the cadmium concentration in these fractions. Spinach was cultivated after application of sewage sludge on two soils of different properties and total cadmium content in a model pot experiment. Two non‐polar solvents (light petroleum and ethyl acetate), a polar solvent (methanol) and two solvent mixtures (methanol + H2O & H2O and methanol + H2O + HCl) were used in the extraction series. Isolated fractions were characterized by IR spectroscopy. The lower weight of light petroleum (aliphatic hydrocarbons), ethyl acetate (fatty acids), and methanol (carboxylic acids, mainly acids of citric cycle, pyrrole substances) fractions in sludge treatments compared with the controls showed that the metabolism of plant natural products was inhibited by toxins from sludge. The weight of methanol fraction was dominant for all treatments. The cadmium determined in these fractions was low. The majority of cadmium was found in the methanol + H2O & H2O (oligopeptides, mainly phytochelatins, extractable polypeptides, proteins) and methanol + H2O + HCl (compounds isolated from cell walls and cytoskeleton after hydrolysis) fractions. The effect of toxin stress only appears to be on the quantity of substances, as there is no qualitative change observed in the isolated fractions (measured values of IR spectra bands did not differ for treatments tested). The application of sequential analysis for spinach biomass extraction makes it possible to investigate the complex effects of cadmium and other toxins on plant metabolism.
