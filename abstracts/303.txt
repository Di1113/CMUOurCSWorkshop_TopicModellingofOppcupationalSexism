The ν1 (C–H) stretching mode of CHBr3 was investigated in the solvent CDBr3 at room temperature using three‐colour femtosecond CARS and scanning multi‐channel Raman difference spectroscopy (SMT‐RDS). Small but measurable blue shifts (≤1 cm−1) of the isotropic part of the Raman scattering relative to the anisotropic component and upon isotopic dilution are the clear signatures of the Raman non‐coincidence effect and isotopic lineshift, respectively. The experimental results are discussed in terms of theoretical models providing insight in the intermolecular coupling mechanisms. The measured shift ΔνID = 0.73 ± 0.02 cm−1 upon isotopic dilution is found to be dominated by the attractive interaction and is to be compared with the non‐coincidence effect of ΔνNCE = 1.02 ± 0.05 cm−1 for the neat liquid. A 5% decrease in the dephasing rate 1/T2 and a similar change in the linewidth upon infinite dilution are observed and semi‐quantitatively explained via repulsive intermolecular interaction in accordance with an estimate of the corresponding (small) wavenumber shift.
