The effect of the stretching–contraction cycle on the surface composition and morphology of polychloroprene elastomer blended with small amounts of surface‐active polydimethylsiloxane–polysulfone block copolymers was studied using X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Copolymers with a large concentration of rigid polysulfone block showed a substantial drop in the surface concentration of the copolymer additive after the stretching–contraction cycle, while copolymers with a large concentration of flexible siloxane segments retained their surface composition practically unchanged. Wrinkling of surface areas occupied by the additive, which occurred upon contraction of the sample to its initial dimensions, is believed to be the reason for the observed drop in surface concentration of the rigid copolymer additive. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
