By using 1‐methyl‐2‐formyl‐5‐Y‐substituted pyrroles (1‐Ys), 1‐methyl‐2‐formyl‐5‐Y‐substituted pyrrole phenylhydrazones (2‐Ys) and 1‐methyl‐2‐formyl‐5‐Y‐substituted pyrrole (4‐nitrophenyl)hydrazones (3‐Ys) as models for nitrogen‐containing heterocyclic aromatic compounds, the K‐band λmax values of their UV spectra were measured. Correlation analysis of the νmax values by a dual‐parameter equation shows that the νmax values of these compounds are affected, albeit to different degrees, by both the polar (σ
