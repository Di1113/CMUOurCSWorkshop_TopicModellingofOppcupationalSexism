Polymer gel electrolytes were investigated for an electrochromic device (ECD) using nickel oxide thin film. Poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) derivatives were cross‐linked and swelled in KOH–aqueous solution giving a hydrogel electrolyte. The ECD containing the uniformly cross‐linked hydrogel showed good result in electrochromic switching performance. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Appl Polym Sci 83: 1305–1308, 2002
