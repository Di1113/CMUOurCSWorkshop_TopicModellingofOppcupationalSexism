We studied the structural, magnetic and electrical properties as a function of the average size of the A cation site, 〈rA〉, in the perovskite manganite (Pr1—yMy)0.7Sr0.3MnO3 oxides with y = 0, 0.1 and M = Sm, Bi. X‐ray diffraction investigations show that our synthesized samples crystallize in the orthorhombic symmetry with Pnma space group. Magnetic measurements versus temperature in an applied magnetic field of 500 Oe show that all our samples exhibit a paramagnetic to ferromagnetic transition when temperature decreases. The Curie temperature TC decreases from 265 to 215 K when 〈rA〉 varies from 1.2183 to 1.2150 Å. Electrical measurements show that all samples exhibit a semiconducting to metallic transition with decreasing temperature. The electrical transition temperature decreases with decreasing 〈rA〉.
