The hepatoprotective effects of Ixeris laevigata Sch‐Bip. var. oldhami Kitam. (IL) were studied on cholestatic hepatitis induced by α‐naphthylisothiocyanate (ANIT, 100 mg/10  mL/kg, in olive oil, i.p.) and acute hepatitis induced by carbon tetrachloride (20% CCl4/olive oil, 1.5 mL/kg, i.p.) in rats. Hepatoprotective activity was monitored by estimating the serum transaminases levels and the histopathological changes in the livers of experimental rats. The pretreatment of animals with IL, extract (0.3–2.0 g/kg orally) significantly inhibited the acute elevation of serum transaminases, as well as the hepatotoxin‐induced histopathological changes in the livers of the experimental rats.
