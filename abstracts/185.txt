Osteolysis remains the most important problem in orthopedic implant failure. Wear debris from the implant contains polyethylene (PE) particulate which has been shown to activate monocyte‐derived macrophages (MDM). Although the response of MDM has been shown to be influenced by the size, shape, and chemical type of PE, the effect of chemically altered PE on MDM has not been studied. In this study, human MDM were seeded onto glass coverslips coated with virgin high density (HD)PE and chemically modified HDPE (impregnated with ppm levels of CoCl2 and oxidized by heat) mixed with type I collagen and cultured for 96 h. Light microscopic evaluation demonstrated consistent phagocytosis of the HDPE particulate that was confirmed by scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy with little evidence of cytotoxicity. Evaluation of pro‐inflammatory mediator secretion by MDMs in response to the virgin and chemically modified HDPE revealed significant differences in interleukin (IL)‐1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)‐α, and IL‐6 secretion. A significant elevation of IL‐1 secretion was observed after initial exposure to virgin HDPE particles compared with controls (p = 0.001). IL‐1 secretion was also elevated in the low oxidized particle groups (p = 0.001), whereas the highly oxidized particles were not different than controls. Secretion of both IL‐6 (p = 0.03) and TNF‐α (p = 0.007) were significantly elevated by the low oxidized HDPE particles whereas the virgin and highly oxidized groups showed no difference. The different effects on MDM activation when HDPE surface chemistry was altered, highlight the importance of defining the particle properties when studying the role of MDM activation in in vitro systems and extrapolating these observations to the in vivo situation. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
