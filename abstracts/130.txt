The formation of composite particles in the electron liquid under QHE conditions discussed by Jain in generalizing Laughlins many‐particle state is considered by using a model for two‐dimensional guiding center configurations. At first we describe the self‐consistent field of electron repulsion by a negative parabolic potential on an effective center and a remaining inter‐center amount. From this we show that with increasing magnetic field the ground state of so‐called primary composite particles ν = 1/q, q = 1,3,5, …, is given for higher negative quantum numbers of the total angular momentum. By clustering of primary composite particles due to absorption or emission of flux quanta we explain phenomenologically the quasi‐particle structure behind the series of relevant filling factors ν = p/q, p = 1,2,3, …. Our considerations show that the complicate interplay of electron–magnetic field and electron–electron interactions in QHE systems may be understood in terms of adding flux quanta Φ0 to charges e and binding of charges by flux quanta.
