The performance of thermoplastic composites is known to depend on the intrinsic properties of the two composite components, the quality of the fiber–matrix interface, and the crystalline properties of their matrix. The objective of this work is to characterize the effect of the addition of modified polypropylene (PP) and silane coupling agent on the mechanical and interfacial properties of short fiber reinforced PP composites. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), single fiber composite fragmentation tests (SFC), and mechanical testing are used to understand the different parameters regulating the interfacial properties of composites. No influence of the modified PP on the level of crystallinity is observed. Some differences in the size of the spherulites are observed for acrylic acid grafted PP (PP‐g‐AA). Those samples also show lower mechanical properties in spite of good interfacial interactions. Maleic anhydride grafted PP (PP‐g‐MAh) leads to better mechanical performances than PP‐g‐AA. A high MAh content PP‐g‐MAh grade with low viscosity is the best polymeric additive used in the present work. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. J Appl Polym Sci 78: 2047–2060, 2000
