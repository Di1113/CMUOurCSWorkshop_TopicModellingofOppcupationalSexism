Advances in solar cell manufacturing systems for large‐area Silicon‐Film™ polycrystalline silicon sheet material are reviewed. Recent progress in continuous rapid thermal junction diffusion and cassetteless wet chemical processing is discussed. A single Silicon‐Film™ sheet generation system operating at 3.1 m/min now has a capacity of 15 MW of silicon sheet per year. This sheet generation system is used as the basis for an advanced single‐thread production line design for manufacturing the next generation of Silicon‐Film™ solar cells whose area is nominally 400 cm2. These solar cells are being used to design large‐area solar modules that can produce up to 220 W of power. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
