The linearized equation for the superconducting gap is solved for a generalized t–J model which also contains phonons within a Holstein model. Keeping leading terms of a 1/N expansion we find that the strongest phonon‐mediated superconducting instability in the presence of strong electronic correlations always occurs in the s‐wave channel with a Tc which is somewhat lower compared to that of non‐interacting electrons, especially at large dopings. The corresponding isotope coefficient β is larger than 1/2 and increases with decreasing doping. For a realistic value for J the leading Tc has always d‐wave symmetry with phonons giving a positive contribution to Tc. β is very small at optimal doping and increases towards the classical value 1/2 with increasing doping similar as in several cuprates.
