This paper proposes the application of cluster algorithms for the identification of changes which may be batched together. The results of impact‚Äêanalysis sessions are represented as binary data where each variable has two values indicating the presence or absence of an impact on a particular software component. These data are then used to produce a matrix containing the similarity or the dissimilarity of each pair of proposed changes which are to be clustered.
