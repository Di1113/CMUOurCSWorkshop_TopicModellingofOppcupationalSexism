Most papers in this issue were presented at the Sixth International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis/Decision Analysis and Support (IIASA/DAS) workshop ‘Decision Support in the Public Sector’ in Delft, 12–13 April 1999. Therefore, it is befitting to explain briefly the objectives, the history, and the fortunes of the DAS project. This short summary may particularly contribute to the on‐going discussions about the integration of methodological research and the future of DAS. Copyright © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
