X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was applied to study the adsorbates on NiP‐plated aluminium (NiP/Al) and glass substrates as used for hard disk production. For both substrates, XPS spectra of the surface as a function of the substrate heating treatment were taken. The substrate was heated in an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) chamber for ∼3 s at the given temperature, which is comparable to the process time in production. The XPS measurements were performed at room temperature after cooling down of the disk.
