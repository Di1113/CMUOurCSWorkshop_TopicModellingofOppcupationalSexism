The characteristics of a microstrip transmission line with a finite‐width curved substrate are investigated in this letter by first employing the fast and accurate finite‐element boundary‐integral method to simulate the current distribution, then using a superresolution estimation of signal parameters via the rotational invariance technique (ESPRIT) algorithm to extract the characteristic parameters of the transmission line. The validity of our simulation tool is confirmed by a comparison of our numerical results and previously published results. Radiation losses due to the finite width of the substrate are also included in this letter. ©1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Microwave Opt Technol Lett 22: 322–323, 1999.
