This paper examines the influence of the presence of source inductance on the conversion gain of a gate mixer. Two effects are observed: degradation of the gain, and an increase of the local oscillator level power necessary to obtain the maximum gain. Nonlinear simulations, theoretical calculations, as well as experimental data demonstrate that these effects become more important in the millimeter‐wave range. ©1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
