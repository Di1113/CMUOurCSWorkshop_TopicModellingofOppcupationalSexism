The crystallographic and magnetic properties of Sm2Fe14—xCoxMn3 with x = 0, 1, 2, and 3 have been investigated using X‐ray diffraction and magnetic measurements. The Sm2Fe14—xCoxMn3 samples crystallised in the rhombohedral Th2Zn17 structure. The unit cell volume decreases with increasing Co concentration. The Curie temperature as well as the saturation magnetisation increases with increasing cobalt contents. The Curie temperature of Sm2Fe11Co3Mn3 is about 470 K and the saturation magnetisation is about 160 emu/g. All the samples exhibit an easy direction of magnetization along the c‐axis.
