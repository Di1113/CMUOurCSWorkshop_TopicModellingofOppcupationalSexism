Mechanical and dielectric relaxation of ultrafiltration hollow fibers were studied by thermally stimulated creep and current, and differential scanning calorimetry. The high sensitivity of thermally stimulated techniques shows 8 relaxations and/or transitions between −150 and 350°C (degradation). Not all are related to the intrinsic nature of the material—indeed, 4 of them can be directly related to the shape of the membrane (porosity, diameters, spinning conditions, etc.). Molecular mechanisms of these phenomena are discussed. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. J Appl Polym Sci 78: 8–13, 2000
