In LoVo cells, phosphorolytic activity acting on deoxyadenosine plays a major role in the resistance to the cytotoxic effect of the combination of deoxynucleoside with deoxycoformycin. In fact, the observed dependence of toxicity on cell density appears to be related to the metabolic conversion of deoxyadenosine into adenine. The phosphorylation of the deoxynucleoside, which represents the first step towards the formation of the cytotoxic agent dATP, proceeds at a significantly lower rate as compared to the phosphorolysis of deoxyadenosine. The analysis of the levels of deoxyadenosine and its derivatives in the incubation media reveals that the rates of disappearance of deoxyadenosine and of formation of adenine increase in concert with the reduction of the effect on cell survival.
