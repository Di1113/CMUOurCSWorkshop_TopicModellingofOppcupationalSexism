Medium‐energy Ion Scattering Spectroscopy (MEISS) can provide non‐destructive quantitative surface and near‐surface composition with atomic layer depth resolution. The special features of MEISS can be utilized to improve quantification of conventional surface analysis techniques by studying preferential sputtering, which is one of the major problems in quantitative surface analysis using sputtering techniques. This phenomenon was studied in detail with MEISS, in situ and ex situ XPS analysis, RBS, and (inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry) for WSi2.
