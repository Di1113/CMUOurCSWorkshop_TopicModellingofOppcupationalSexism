The methanol extract of the leaves of Ficus hispida Linn. (Moraceae) was evaluated for hepatoprotective activity in rats by inducing acute liver damage by paracetamol (750 mg/kg, p.o.). The extract at an oral dose of 400 mg/kg exhibited a significant protective effect by lowering the serum levels of transaminase (SGOT and SGPT), bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). These biochemical observations were supplemented by histopathological examination of liver sections. The activity of extract was also comparable to that of Liv‐52 a known hepatoprotective formulation. Copyright © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
