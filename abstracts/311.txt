Parameters due to an anisotropic character of the electron orbits in cubic metals submitted to the action of an external magnetic field are calculated. These parameters are, in the first step, a nonzero value of the metal magnetoresistance and—in the second step—the nonvanishing electron torque vector and the Runge–Lenz vector. Both these vectors depend on the electron angular momentum in the crystal lattices, which is also examined together with the radius of curvature of the electron orbits. The calculation of magnetoresistance is specified to the case of the body‐centered cubic lattice of metallic iron for which a comparison of the theory with the experimental data for magnetoresistance is also presented. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
