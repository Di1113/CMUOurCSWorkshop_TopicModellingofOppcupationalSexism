The Hispanic MMPI‐A was developed for use with Spanish‐speaking adolescents living in the United States. In order to sample its potential usefulness in other countries, the test was administered to 385 Spanish‐speaking adolescents in Colombia, Mexico, Peru, Spain, and the United States. The results showed a high degree of similarity across the five countries on the basic content and supplementary scales. Most scales were within 1/2 standard deviation of the U.S. Hispanic mean, and no scale elevations were greater than T = 65. Slight differences (T = 55–60) were obtained on scale F for males and scales F, Hs, Mf (Peru and Colombia), Pa, and Sc for females. This study would suggest that the Hispanic MMPI‐A, with its established norms, is appropriate for adaptation in Spanish‐speaking countries other than the United States. Further studies with the Hispanic MMPI‐A are recommended to determine its effectiveness in clinical assessment in Spanish‐speaking countries. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
