A series of experiments were conducted on the uplink diversity characteristics for a mobile communication system using the random field method. In contrast to past belief, it was found that polarization diversity systems are much more effective than space diversity systems for mobile communications. This is due to the orientation of mobile antennas that are tilted about 60Â° from the zenith in normal conversation state and by the horizontal polarization component that is generated by the human body and mobile phone casing.
