Several lines of evidence indicate that the adapter molecule p130CAS (crk‐associated substrate (CAS)) is required for src‐mediated cellular transformation. CAS has been shown to be heavily tyrosine‐phosphorylated in src‐transformed cells, and genetic variants of src that are deficient in CAS binding are also unable to mediate cellular transformation. In this report, we investigated whether CAS phosphorylation and/or its association with src are required elements of the transformation process. Expression of the carboxy‐terminal src binding domain of CAS in Rat 1 fibroblasts expressing a temperature‐sensitive allele of v‐src inhibited the formation of src‐CAS complexes and also inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of CAS. However, expression of this protein had no effect on morphological transformation, src‐mediated actin rearrangements, or anchorage‐independent growth of these cells when grown at the src‐permissive temperature. Thus, the ability of activated src to mediate cellular transformation is either largely independent of endogenous CAS phosphorylation and/or its association with CAS or, alternatively, the carboxy‐terminus of CAS may substitute for endogenous CAS in the process of src‐mediated transformation.
