The effects of hydrogen absorption on the electrochemical, magnetic and magnetoelastic properties of amorphous Fe73.5M1Nb3Si13.5B9 alloys (M = Cu, Pt, Ag, Pd, Mn) were investigated. Hydrogen was charged cathodically for 30 min with cathodic current density of 50 A/m2 in all samples using 0.5M H2SO4 solution with 0.1 g/l As2O3 as a poison. It was observed that the partial substitution of Pt, Mn, Ag, Pd for Cu in Fe73.5Cu1Nb3Si13.5B9 has a great influence in the hydrogen absorption properties.
