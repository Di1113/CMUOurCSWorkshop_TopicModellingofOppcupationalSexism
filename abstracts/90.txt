Lobbying is a necessary element in the European Community's (EC's) legislative process which, rather than being viewed with suspicion, is generally welcomed by the EC's law‐making institutions. This article examines lobbying in the context of EC environmental law. It introduces the EC's law‐making institutions, explains the procedures used to adopt EC environmental laws and shows how these will be altered if the recent Amsterdam treaty comes into force. The stages at which lobbying may be used to influence the content of proposed EC environmental laws are examined in detail. Finally, the article discusses some examples of lobbying and its impact in practice in the field of EC environmental law. Copyright © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.
