We study the influence of various excitations on the anomalous field effect observed in insulating indium‐oxide films. In conductance G versus gate‐voltage Vg measurements one observes a characteristic cusp around the Vg at which the system has equilibrated. In the absence of any disturbance this cusp may persist for a long time after a new gate voltage was imposed on the sample and hence reflects a memory of the previous equilibrium state. This memory is believed to be related to the correlations between electrons. Here we show that exciting the conduction electrons by exposing the sample to IR light degrades this memory. We argue that any excitation that randomizes the system destroys the correlations and therefore impairs the memory.
