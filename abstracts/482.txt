A graphical procedure for assessment of wet‐ and dry‐spell duration is proposed based on the monthly rainfall amounts, in order to depict the change of period duration with their number within a given record length. A linear regression formulation is described on a log– log plot between spell durations and numbers. The application of this methodology has been presented for 16 rainfall stations distributed over the entire Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Because the longest durations of wet and dry periods occur once in the whole record length their predictions can be found from the double logarithmic graphs corresponding to occurrence number one. It has been observed that the longest durations of wet periods occur in the south‐eastern part of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, where highest elevations in the Kingdom are found. However, the longest dry spell durations occur in the central and eastern part of the country. © 1997 by the Royal Meteorological Society.
