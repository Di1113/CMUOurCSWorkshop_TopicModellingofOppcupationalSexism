The mechanism of magnetization reversal in the RSG phase of NiMn layer in NiMn/Cu/Ni trilayer films, with different Cu spacer thickness, has been studied in relation with the domain structure based on the Barkhausen process. The analysis of the time dependent magnetization suggests that the dynamics of small regime, on nanoscale, governs the magnetization reversal process at smaller amplitude of magnetic field. As the amplitude of applied field increases, the macroscopic dynamics, related to the domain wall motion, replaces the microscopic dynamics. Thus, the two stages of magnetization reversal characterize the magnetization process of RSG phase of NiMn thin film.
