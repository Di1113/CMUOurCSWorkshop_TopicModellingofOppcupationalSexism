To clarify the role of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)‐α on osteoblast functions in the presence of metal particles, two human osteoblast‐like cell lines (MG‐63 and SaOS‐2) were cultured with TNF‐α in the presence or absence of titanium particles in vitro. A combination of TNF‐α and titanium particles showed additive effects on inhibition of cell proliferation and alkaline phosphatase production. On the other hand, production of interleukin‐6, which is well known to induce osteoclastogenesis and to directly stimulate bone resorption, was additively stimulated by the combination of TNF‐α and titanium particles. These results suggest that the association of TNF‐α and titanium particles may play an important role in the pathogenesis of periprosthetic osteolysis through two different pathways: a reduced periprosthetic bone formation due to inhibition of osteoblast proliferation and alkaline phosphatase production, and osteoblast‐mediated activation of osteoclastic bone resorption as suggested by the enhancement of interleukin‐6 production. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
