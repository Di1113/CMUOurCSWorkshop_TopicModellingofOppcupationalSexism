Selected ancient Vietnamese (proto)porcelains and celadons (13–16th centuries) from the Ha Lan (Nam Ð inh), Chu Ðâu (Nam Sach, Hai Duong) and Hop Lê (Binh Giang, Hai Duong) ceramic kilns were studied by chemical analysis, macro‐ and micro‐Raman spectroscopy, thermal expansion and differential thermal analysis. Raman spectra of quartz, cristobalite, rutile, mullite, anatase, iron oxide, amphibole and glassy phases were analysed and their evolutions are used to discuss the ancient ceramic technology (raw materials used, firing procedures of the glaze and body, etc.). Structural composition data taken from thermal expansion measurements and Raman spectroscopy are in good agreement. Particular attention is given to the analysis of glaze for the feasible discrimination between original artefacts and modern copies. On the basis of experimental results, the samples made at Chu Ð au can be considered as true porcelains, whereas those made at Hop Lê and Ha Lan had evolutions towards porcelain and high‐temperature‐fired fine faience, respectively.
