In this article, the characterization of the microstructure and interface of hybrid composites is discussed. Poly(p‐phenylene biphenyltetracarboximide) was used as a matrix polymer and tetraethoxysilane was a precursor of silica. Polyimide/silica hybrid composites were prepared by sol–gel reaction and thermal imidization. Interfacial interaction as well as microstructure in polyimide/silica hybrid composites were well characterized by atomic force microscopy topology and small‐angle X‐ray scattering measurements. In addition, fluorescence spectroscopy was successfully applied in the studies to reveal the interfacial interaction in the hybrid systems. Copyright © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
