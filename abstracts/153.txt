Shorter analogues of a continuous epitope of hepatitis A virus, VP3(110–121) peptide, failed to react with convalescent sera, indicating the importance of the entire peptide in the epitope structure. To better understand the influence of the structural properties of this 12‐mer peptide epitope on its biological activity, the interaction of smaller peptide analogues with phospholipid biomembrane models was investigated by a combination of spectroscopic and biophysical techniques. In this article we describe our findings concerning the surface activity and the interaction of peptides with simple mono‐ and bilayer membranes composed of a zwitterionic phospholipid (dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine, DPPC), an anionic phospholipid (dipalmitoyl phosphatidylglicerol, DPPG), or a DPPC/DPPG mixture. The results indicate that the net negative charge of the peptide is in some way responsible of the specific interactions between VP3(110–121) and membrane phospholipids, and necessary to induce β‐type conformations upon vesicle interaction. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
