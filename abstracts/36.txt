Strong films were prepared from an RNA/lipid complex by casting from organic solutions. RNA (mainly tRNA) was extracted from yeasts, followed by a replacement of the sodium counterions of the tRNA phosphate units by cationic amphiphiles. RNA units in the RNA/lipid film could be aligned in one direction by stretching due to the presence of intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The film showed physical strength and was biodegradable.
