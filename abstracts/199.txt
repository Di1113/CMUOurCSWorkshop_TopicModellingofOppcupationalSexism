Gas hold‐up and liquid circulation velocity measurements were made using a 167 dm3 external loop airlift reactor. The gas‐separator was of the open channel configuration. The reactor height was 2.5 m with riser and downcomer diameters of 0.19 m and 0.14 m respectively. The systems investigated were Newtonian air–water and air–glycerol with the superficial air velocity varying between 0.02 and 0.12 m s−1. The ratio of the liquid volume in the gas‐separator to the liquid volume in the reactor (volume‐ratio) was varied from 0.0% to 37%, to find its minimum critical value for optimum operation of the airlift reactor. For the air–water system, discernible effects of the volume‐ratio on riser and, downcomer gas hold‐ups and liquid circulation velocity were observed at volume ratios ≤7%. Beyond this value, the volume‐ratio had no effect. For a viscous and foaming air–glycerol system the critical volume‐ratio was increased to 19%. New and simple correlations for predicting gas hold‐up in the riser, gas hold‐up in the downcomer, and liquid circulation velocity were developed with reasonable accuracy.
