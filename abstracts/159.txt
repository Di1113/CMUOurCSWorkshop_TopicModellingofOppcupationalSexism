A new photorefractive composite based on a bifunctional methacrylate copolymer with N‐methacryloxypropyl‐3‐(p‐nitrophenyl)azo carbazole and N‐methacryloxypropyl carbazole as pendant side chains, which has high stability and potential applications, was synthesized. A two‐beam coupling gain coefficient of 9.4 cm−1 and an electrooptic coefficient of 9.3 pm/V were measured at the applied electric field of 92.4 V/μm by a typical two‐beam coupling experiment and a compensation electrooptic measurement technique. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
