The ‘comet’ assay appears to be a promising tool for estimating DNA damage at the single cell level. We used this test to evaluate the effect of organotin compounds on sea bream nucleated erythrocytes. The tributyltin chloride (TBTC), dibutyltin chloride (DBTC) and monobutyltin chloride (MBTC) employed in this study show different genotoxicities. TBTC and DBTC have pronounced effects on tail length, tail intensity and tail moment, though TBTC is more efficient in producing DNA damage. MBTC leads to a fast genotoxic effect that does not change with the incubation time. The data obtained are important for the analysis of the environmental risks produced by organotin compounds used as antifouling agents in marine paints and as biocides in agriculture.
