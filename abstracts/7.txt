Correlation equations for saturated and subcooled film boiling heat transfer from a downward‐facing horizontal circular plate are proposed based on a theoretical study using an integral method. For the case of subcooled liquids, a dimensionless heat transfer parameter is introduced to effectively correlate within ±15% the experimental data obtained under both quenching and steady‐state conditions. © 1998 Scripta Technica, Heat Trans Jpn Res, 26(7): 459–468, 1997
