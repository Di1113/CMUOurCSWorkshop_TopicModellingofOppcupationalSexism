The linewidth of the 1H NMR signal (7.05 T) of human whole blood titrated with a superparamagnetic contrast agent (NC100150 injection) was evaluated at different blood oxygen tensions. In deoxygenated blood and low contrast agent concentrations, NC100150 injection caused a decrease in linewidth. After reaching a minimum, the linewidth increased as the concentration of NC100150 injection increased. At the concentration corresponding to the minimum linewidth, the magnetization of the extracellular space containing the NC100150 injection was equal to that of the paramagnetic (deoxygenated hemoglobin) intracellular space. The minimum linewidth is therefore consistent with a complete elimination of the local microscopic susceptibility effect, the major cause of linebroadening. Additionally, phantom studies were performed at 1.5 T, confirming that the contrast enhancement of NC100150 injection in blood is dependent on oxygen tension. The data suggest that NC100150 injection may be useful in differentiating vessels with varying relative oxygen tensions. Magn Reson Med 44:803–807, 2000. © 2000 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.
