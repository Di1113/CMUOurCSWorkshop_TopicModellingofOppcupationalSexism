In this work, we attempted two different ways of processing to improve interfacial adhesion of polypropylene (PP) and ethylene–propylene–diene terpolymer (EPDM) by introducing maleic anhydride (MAH); In one way, the in situ grafting and dynamic vulcanization (ISGV) were performed simultaneously from PP and EPDM with MAH in the presence of dicumyl peroxide (DCP) in an intensive mixer. In another way, PP was first grafted with MAH and then the PP‐g‐MAH was blended with EPDM in the intensive mixer in the presence of DCP by the dynamic vulcanization (DV). It was found that the glass transition temperatures (Tgs) of both PP and EPDM phases were shifted to higher temperature as the EPDM content increased for the blends prepared by both IGSV and DV methods, mainly due to the crosslinking of EPDM. The higher Tgs and larger storage moduli were observed for the blends prepared by the ISGV method than those prepared by the DV method, while the morphology showed that the size reduction of dispersed particles in latter blends was larger than that of the former blends. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
