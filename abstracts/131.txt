We examined gender differences in comorbid Axis I disorders in 236 outpatients with major depression. Axis I comorbidity, age of onset of depression and comorbid disorder were assessed with the SCID‐P. Depression severity was assessed with the HAM‐17. The results indicated that males had a higher rate of comorbid substance abuse/dependence, while females had a higher rate of comorbid bulimia nervosa. These results are consistent with previous research, with the marked exception that females did not have higher rates of anxiety disorders in general, and in particular, panic disorder, simple and social phobia, obsessive‐compulsive disorder and agoraphobia. It is concluded that the female predominance in anxiety disorders found in general population studies may be due to comorbidity with depression.
