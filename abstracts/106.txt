Distribution of peak spacings of the Coulomb oscillation is theoretically investigated in disordered quantum dots. Taking account of the electron–electron interaction by the perturbation, we show that a pair‐type (BCS‐type) correlation plays an important role in determining the distribution in the diffusive region. The correlation effect can result in a sharp peak structure of the distribution, deviating drastically from the prediction of the random matrix theory, in the absence of a magnetic field. Numerical results support the proposed mechanisms. The pair‐type correlation does not work in the presence of a magnetic field.
