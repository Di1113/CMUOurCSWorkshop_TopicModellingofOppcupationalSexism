Regeneration in the adult central nervous system (CNS) is thought to be hampered by the lesion‚Äêinduced activation of astrocytes and meningeal cells and the consecutive formation of a glial scar. The substrate properties of reactive astrocytes differ significantly from their neonatal counterparts, which promote axon growth, but in spite of intensive studies the underlying molecular changes are still not fully understood. We have used two cell culture systems to compare the expression of certain surface molecules on neonatal astrocytes, reactive astrocytes and meningeal cells in vitro.
