Interpolymer complexes of chitosan and carboxymethyl cellulose were synthesized by γ‐irradiation in acetic acid/water solution, using methylenebisacrylamide (MBAAM) as a crosslinker. FTIR and atomic force microscopy were used to determine their structures. The hydrogels swell in water, and their swelling behaviour is strongly affected by the ion strength of the solution, which indicates that a polyampholytic hydrogel is formed.
