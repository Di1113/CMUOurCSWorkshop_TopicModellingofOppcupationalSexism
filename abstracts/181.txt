A study on the effect of tape dimensions on the performance of a helix slow‐wave structure in traveling‐wave tubes is proposed. The influence of the tape dimensions (i.e., width and thickness) on the normalized phase velocity and interaction impedance has been considered. A proper choice of tape dimensions is essential to achieve optimum performance for the slow‐wave structure. A measured helix slow‐wave structure operating in the 6–18 GHz frequency range was considered for the study. ©1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Microwave Opt Technol Lett 23: 147–149, 1999.
