Application of a gate voltage across a hopping conduction system adds energy to the electronic subsystem, which can be exploited to provide additional transitions downward in energy, and enhance the conductance. After turning off the gate voltage, energy is lost slowly to the phonon system by the same downward in energy transitions. The time scale for this process is governed by the time dependence of the specific heat, and consequently, a logarithmic decay of the conductivity enhancement for short times, and a power‐law decay at long times, are predicted. While such results are in general accord with experiment, the experiments were performed under conditions compatible with a “Coulomb glass”, while the present calculations are for the “Fermi glass”. Nevertheless, analogies between the two systems exist, so this calculation may be useful for future efforts.
