An investigation was carried out to examine the conduction mechanism in poly(pyromellitic‐4,4‐diphenyl sulphone) [PPDS] films prepared by cast method. The electrical properties were measured in aluminum/polymer/aluminum structure over the temperature range (30–100 °C). At low field region, Ohm's law was obeyed whilst at fields high enough to cause injection of charge carriers, the electrodes supplied all the carriers and Schottky effect mechanism was observed as a prevail one. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
