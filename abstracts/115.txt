Statistical tolerance limits have been widely applied in the area of applied statistics, particularly in engineering, manufacturing, reliability, and quality control processes in industries. This article attempts to generalize the one‐way model into the balanced two‐way random effect model and suggest various alternative tolerance limits as a special case of the new complexity. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
